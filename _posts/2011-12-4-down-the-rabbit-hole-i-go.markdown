title: Down The Rabbit Hole I Go...
---

Well, I've been putting this off for 4 years now, but I was finally convinced to create
a public blog.

I'll be posting articles that relate to Entrepreneurship, Silicon Valley, Web Tech, 
Electrical & Nano Engineering, Philosophy, and more. I also have a lame tumblr blog 
where I post nearly everything I find funny or interesting while I browse the net, 
[here it is](http://ztratar.tumblr.com). I warn you, itâ€™s mostly cats.

Expect worthwhile posts soon! I promise to keep the cats away from this section... 
for a while.
