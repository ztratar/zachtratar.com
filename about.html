		<h2>I dream things up and build them.</h2>
		<p>I started 2 companies while studying Computer Engineering at UIUC, left school to join Backplane, and love UX, psychology, and engineering.</p>
		<p>The first company was a terrible failure.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Our mission was to clean up politics.</li>
			<li>We were freshmen in college.</li>
			<li>We had never built a product before.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I bring this up is because the experience can clearly give you a sense of who I am. Rattling off a resume is boring and I don't believe in boring an audience.</p>
		<p>Passion to solve the world's biggest problems is my sole driving force and so far I haven't been able to find the brake. The world has too many things wrong with it but too much beauty to let apathy and inaction win.</p>
		<p>I'm idealistic when it comes to ideas and realistic when it comes to execution. The realism didn't come natural... I think it's a byproduct of countless bug smashing sessions.</p>
		<h3>SO HOW'D I GET INTO TECH IN THE FIRST PLACE?</h3>
		<p>I found my love for engineering early. In elementary school I would bike down to the local RadioShack to buy electrical components for home-made RC cars. After taking my first physics class, I started to spec out and design new engines. Of course they weren't very efficient, but there were badass! Fun fact: I thought I was onto a big idea for an engine using the earth's magnetic field and the right-hand-rule until I realized, after 2 weeks, that I was disobeying Newton's 2nd law. /fail</p>
		<p>So yea -- building things. Fun stuff!</p>
		<p>Growing up in Chicago was seemingly perfect if you looked at it from afar, but there are problems everywhere in the world. I watched my family and others suffer from systems that were quite obviously broken. An easily exploitable legal system, a volatile housing market, the substandard to which the American dream has plunged and it's psychological torture on small business owners... you get the idea.</p>
		<p>I only have evidence thats states my problems are absolutely minimal compared to others. It's not like I'm fighting malaria or losing my savings to superinflation.</p>
		<p>So what does this mean? It means that there are a lot of solutions out there just waiting to be discovered, designed, and engineered. Software is the scalable medium to tackle most of these problems and I have therefore put myself at the forefront of the industry.</p>
		<h3>WHATCHA DOIN' NOW?</h3>
		<p>I'm building Vibe -- the best way for teams to give each other feedback. No hassle -- it just works.</p>
		<p>Someone more qualified: go fix politics for the rest of us! (please?)</p>
