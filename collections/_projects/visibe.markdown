Trending news from social media, before the news ticker on the right
columns of Facebook & LinkedIn existed.

I thought it would be a fun project to collect as much social network
data as possible, especially before privacy was more refined on the
internet.

It was cool, back in 2013, to see trends happening across different
networks and sites. Still, ML clustering of topics hadn't gone
mainstream & no big player was making social trends obvious.

I started sketching...

I collaborated with another developer to build our Visibe. He advocated
for Clojure & Clojurescript, and I was interested in learning a new
language. LISP has an iconic status amongst programmers -- well deserved
-- but it was probably the wrong language choice for this project.

Nevertheless, we designed something pretty cool together.

On the home screen, you could see all of the trending topics.

Clicking one of them would dive into a new view that showed the best,
most recent posts from any source.

I guess it was a good idea, as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn ended up
coming out with similar "in network" features ~10 months after we
designed Visibe.
