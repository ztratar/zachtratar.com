While a traditional career coach can only handle about 5 clients at
once, our coaches could handle over 200.

How? We built them technology to scale up their efforts. All of this
[was built on top of our GraphQL Node/React Boilerplate](https://zachtratar.com/projects/graphql-react-node-boilerplate). Check that out if you're curious about the technical implementation.

Coaching can be broken down into sub-processes:

- **Learning about someone.** You can do this indirectly by automatically gathering data or directly through questions.
- **Providing conversational insights.** Based on what you know about
  the coachee, recommending things to talk about or providing useful knowledge.

Our system appeared simply as chat to the end user, but under the hood
we had powerful tools to semi-automate each of the above sub-processes.

You could create any sort of structured data, connect a response (aka
"snippet") to it, and let the software do the heavy lifting for similar
users later in time.
