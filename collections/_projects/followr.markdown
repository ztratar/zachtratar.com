Back in 2013 & 2014, I wrote a chrome extension for Twitter called Followr. It still has about 12,000 Daily Active Users.

The "Twitter Bot" was designed to help new users gain followers, since seeing the value of Twitter as a new user is immensely difficult. I'm quite amazed this still hasn't been solved.

[I wrote a lot about Followr here](https://zachtratar.com/followr.html) and [more
