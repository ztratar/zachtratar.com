I have to admit, this is probably my weirdest project.

I set out to create a social experiment inspired by the crazy, dot-com entrepreneur Josh Harris via the documentary "We Live in Public."

Enter "We Browse In Public," a Chrome extension that live streams your browsing activity to the public & let's them... watch you. It's like a [twitch.tv](http://twitch.tv) for your browser.

DEMO

Whether we like it or not, our society is changing and privacy is being disrupted. In China, privacy is practically non-existent. In Europe, large regulations like the GDPR, are putting a strangle-hold on startups in the name of privacy. In the US, we idealize privacy but don't actively protect it.

Where will this lead us? Who knows. What's right? It's up to the citizens of each country.

Nonetheless, we can test what the experience would be like at certain extremes.

I hacked We Browse In Public over a weekend in 2012 and never launched it. Why? Well, I was mostly just playing around with code & kept adding features... never launching it. I'm still kind of thinking about giving it a shot, but it's not at the top of my priority list.
