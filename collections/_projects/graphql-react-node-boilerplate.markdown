GraphQL Node/React Boilerplate, (GNRP for short) is a fast way to start building out a custom GraphQL project. And yes, GraphQL is as awesome as promised.

You can find the [open source code on github](https://github.com/ztratar/graphql-node-react-boilerplate). It is available for non-commercial use.

Warning: This repo is still using an old version of Apollo (apollo-client). Apollo has gone through a number of improvements & breaking changes. I intend to upgrade this repo to a newer version, and will do so when I have more time.

## Features

## Backstory

This is a heavily stripped down code-base that ran our startup, [Jobstart](https://www.jobstart.com), in production for more than year and a half with 99% uptime. We were involved in the GraphQL & Apollo communities, presented some of our ideas at Apollo Day, and [published one of the top guides to getting started with GraphQL]([https://www.jobstart.com/posts/graphql-tutorial-getting-started](https://www.jobstart.com/posts/graphql-tutorial-getting-started)).

We've implemented custom solutions to some issues, which are included in this project and available as separate repositories:

- [Apollo-errors]([https://github.com/thebigredgeek/apollo-errors](https://github.com/thebigredgeek/apollo-errors)) (6,400 weekly downloads)
- [Apollo-resolvers]([https://github.com/thebigredgeek/apollo-resolvers](https://github.com/thebigredgeek/apollo-resolvers)) (1,400 weekly downloads)

This boilerplate works, but best practices as defined by open-source communities are always changing, especially for GraphQL.
