One of the products we built at Jobstart was a full-fledged career
services marketplace.

[It was built on top of our GraphQL Node/React
Boilerplate](https://zachtratar.com/projects/graphql-react-node-boilerplate). Although there are many complex features, the codebase was tidy &
well organized... and that made all of our team happy!

The goal was to get people career assistance as fast as possible, and in a scalable, decentralized manner. The product worked beautifully and had a high NPS on both sides.

## Career Services Video Demo

I recommend you watch the video at 1.5x speed, so it's about 4 minutes
long. ðŸ˜ƒ

From the perspective of an expert, this is how you could meet potential
talent on Jobstart.

We moved away from this product strategy to pursue a recurring revenue business
model.
