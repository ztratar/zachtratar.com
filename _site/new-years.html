<div class="container blog-article">
	<p>I&#8217;ve never made new years resolutions before, so this is a completely new experience. A quote I recently read inspired me to make this list:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Our own life is the instrument with which we experiment with the truth&#8221; - Thich Nhat Hang</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id='read_write_and_learn_more'>Read, write, and learn more</h2>

<p>A couple months ago I got a Kindle Paperwhite and rediscovered reading as a hobby. First I dove into <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Cloud-Atlas-Novel-David-Mitchell/dp/0375507256'>Cloud Atlas</a>, a truly unique novel whose plot spans multiple lifetimes. I had never &#8220;gotten lost&#8221; in a book before, so reading CA was such a unique experience that I picked up an urge to keep reading. So far, it&#8217;s been great! Next up on my reading list are <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Signal-Noise-Many-Predictions-Fail/dp/159420411X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1357072711&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=signal+and+noise'>The Signal and the Noise</a> and <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Confessions-Public-Speaker-English/dp/1449301959/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1357072741&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=confessions+of+a+public+speaker'>Confessions of a Public Speaker</a>.</p>

<p>I watched a couple documentaries &#8211; my favorites being <a href='http://video.pbs.org/video/1312522241/'>Becoming Human</a> and <a href='http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/guns-germs-and-steel/'>Guns, Germs, and Steel</a>. These two documentaries together tell a very wholistic story of humanity. Really fascinating stuff. I&#8217;m definitely going to write a blog post about those two next.</p>

<p>Over the course of reading and watching, I&#8217;ve also started taking notes on everything I learn. Hopefully this will turn into better developed thoughts and more writing! My goal for 2013 is to read 2 books, watch 8 documentaries, and write 2 blog posts every month.</p>

<h2 id='become_a_morning_person'>Become a morning person</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m currently a night owl. It&#8217;s likely a habit I developed through Computer Engineering MPs or in High School from late night gaming sessions. Gotta love being a nerd. Lately though, I&#8217;ve noticed that whenever I can wake up earlier in the morning &#8211; usually by luck &#8211; I&#8217;m much more prepared to take on the day.</p>

<p>Startup cultures aren&#8217;t very strict with morning work schedules. Without outside factors forcing me to wake up earlier, I&#8217;m going to create one through this new years resolution! In addition to waking up earlier, I&#8217;m going to try and get 8 hours of sleep a night. That&#8217;s gonna be hard to pull off.</p>

<h2 id='explore_new_activities'>Explore new activities</h2>

<p>People commonly refer to maintaining a balance between mind, body, and spirit. My currently lifestyle is 100% mind and to hell with the rest. I know it&#8217;s cliche, but it&#8217;s time to start working out again! The goal is 2 times a week.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not much of a spiritual person, but I think there is a silver-lining in many practices normally considered spiritual. After reading both <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Sacred-Hoops-Spiritual-Lessons-Hardwood/dp/1401308813'>Sacred Hoops</a> and <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Steve-Jobs-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1451648537/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1357072868&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=steve+jobs'>Steve Jobs</a>, I&#8217;ve become interested in Zen meditation. I don&#8217;t see it as a way to reach enlightenment or anything, but just as a way to organize thoughts and gain an inner sense of calmness. When I&#8217;m in that calm, brainstorming state (which right now only happens randomly), I get my best ideas. If I can start inducing that state on demand I think I can be more productive. Goal: play around with meditation. If I like it, 2-3 times a week sounds good.</p>

<p>I really want to travel more and explore cultures that I have no connection with. An all-out road trip throughout an entire continent or country sounds exciting&#8230; probably China, Brazil, or Western Europe. Not sure which yet &#8211; anyone have recommendations?</p>

<h2 id='material_lifestyle_improvements'>Material lifestyle improvements</h2>

<p>People give a bad rap to goals that involve material goods, but screw it, I&#8217;m putting them in here.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to finally be getting a car and, at some point, I want to move into my own place downtown SF. I&#8217;ve only experienced living in a city for 3 days before, but even from that show time I could tell I was a city person. The new apartment will also be the first time I get real furniture and not just the cheapest thing I can find at IKEA (No hate. IKEA has served me well in the past).</p>

<p>Once that&#8217;s set up, I want to rig the apartment with tech. <a href='http://arduino.cc/blog/category/hacks/home-hacks/'>Automate tasks with arduinos</a>&#8230; maybe a Rube Goldberg machine to make breakfast? Haha.</p>

<p>Alright&#8230; now I officially have a list of things to which I can hold myself accountable. Blog post #1 <em>done</em>!</p>
