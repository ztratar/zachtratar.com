<p>Well, I&#8217;ve been putting this off for 4 years now, but I was finally convinced to create a public blog.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be posting articles that relate to Entrepreneurship, Silicon Valley, Web Tech, Electrical &amp; Nano Engineering, Philosophy, and more. I also have a lame tumblr blog where I post nearly everything I find funny or interesting while I browse the net, <a href='http://ztratar.tumblr.com'>here it is</a>. I warn you, itâ€™s mostly cats.</p>

<p>Expect worthwhile posts soon! I promise to keep the cats away from this section&#8230; for a while.</p>
