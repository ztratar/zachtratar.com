						<h2>About</h2>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="section-width">
					<p>
						I want to make the world a much better place.
					</p>
					<p>
						That's it! I guess since you went through the effort to click 'about', I can oblige to tell you a bit more about myself.
					</p>
					<h3>What You'd Expect</h3>
					<p>
						What you'd expect is probably pretty basic. Where I'm from, what my favorite food is, my work, etc. But reading crap like that won't
						give you real insight into me. Instead, I'll talk about some things I'm passionate about.
					<p>
						I believe in a future where every person on this planet is more-or-less happy. Good resources. Abundant energy. Great friends.
						It seems like a wild, impossible idea at first, but why is that? Why do people innately believe this cannot be true?
					</p>
					<p>
						These are the types of questions that keep me moving. Society is not perfect... not even close. But instead of accepting that,  I believe moving to fix it
						is the right mentality.	I move because I feel that we can all do better for each other. Technology
						is my means, and right now, communication is the problem.
					</p>
					<h3>I live/breathe tech</h3>
					<p>	
						Tech became my means because I followed my own curiosity while growing up. While
						other kids were buying soccer balls and paintball guns, I was buying electronics from Radioshack and seeing what kind of stuff I could build. I took
						apart old computers, radios, and electronics because they seemed magical.
					</p>
					<p>
						Eventually this led me to study Computer Engineering at UIUC. That was fun, but I became enthralled with building tech and not simply studying it.
						I quit school while near the top of my class to build Backplane, a community network.
					</p>
					<h3>Building Community</h3>
					<p>
						Online community is close to my heart. The internet is a relatively young technology, and even so, I was able to develop my passion for computers
						online. Really, I was among the first generation who even had that ability.
						Forums were my source of inspiration and knowledge. At the age of 12, I was overclocking my computer to fold proteins for 
						Folding@home, a distributed computing project for disease research. This seemingly random hobby truly turned me into who I am today.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now I'm attempting to pay it forward. Forums were inefficient communication tools and technology has come a long way since then. If I was able
						to find my passion through such a marginal chance, what can happen when that process is both free and easy for the masses?!
						I can't wait -- I'm building the best communication tool to ever exist.
					</p>
					<p>
						I'm an optimist if you can't tell. But don't let that fool you... 
						I'm also an engineer at heart and poke holes in everything. I guess I'm also a realist. Yes -- they can go together!
					</p>
					<h3>Random Stuff</h3>
					<p>
						I love learning about history, exploring nature, traveling, meeting new people, and the occasional off-the-hook party (I'm 22, gimme some slack).
						I also like you. Yeah, you're cool. You read this entire thing!
