                                <title>Introducing BillionaireBoard</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you ever think about what you‚Äôd do with a billion dollars?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not talking about what you‚Äôd choose to buy. Instead, which of the world‚Äôs problems would you try to solve? You could start entire companies, hire people, conduct mass-scale research, and maybe ‚Äî just maybe ‚Äî even influence Governments ü§Ø.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty fun to think about, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bill Gates over the last couple decades has focused on the eradication of malaria, low cost toilets, safe nuclear power, and more. After seeing some of the media around these innovations a while back, I became curious: what are all the other billionaires up to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hours and hours of boring research commenced ‚Äî tax forms, foundation websites, news articles, and even lawsuits. Although major donations were happening every week, building my personal research spreadsheet became an absolute nightmare‚Ä¶ and I was still on my 2nd billionaire!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are ~2,200 billionaires in the world, by the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My plan for research had totally failed, but my questions still felt important:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Who is donating &amp;amp; impact investing into what? How much?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are they giving a lot? What about compared to their lifetime giving, or their net worth?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are these projects, exactly? Are they going well, and is the money being spent well?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are further donations &amp;amp; investments happening in this area?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-we-dont-know&quot;&gt;When we don‚Äôt know&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was thinking about these questions, some tweets rolled into my feed ‚Äî Mark Zuckerberg had just donated a couple hundred million dollars to medical research. What did people do? They mostly took the opportunity to yell at him. There were no questions about the donations, no logical rebuttal of the donations effectiveness, and certainly no thanks. Just outrage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many people understandably default to anger in our age of mass inequality, it‚Äôs also true that Mark has a lifetime goal to ‚Äúcure all diseases‚Äù and has pledged to donate 99% of his wealth to take on the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When should we be celebrating vs judging?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oddly enough, Billionaires and their foundations also operate with limited information. They contract with research institutes, think tanks, and other institutions to help them answer their fundamental question: ‚ÄúHow do I spend this money effectively?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the public can help foundations identify opportunities! In 2016, Jeff Bezos famously posted a ‚Äúrequest for ideas‚Äù on twitter. After thousands of ideas were submitted, Jeff mentioned the process ‚Äúchanged his thinking‚Äù on philanthropy. Crowdsourcing ideas has also proved useful in numerous innovation challenges, including the competition Bill Gates hosted in search of a cheap toilet design!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When should we be celebrating vs judging, and can we somehow help? I figured it was time to build something and find out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;launching-billionaireboard-with-covid-19&quot;&gt;Launching BillionaireBoard with COVID-19&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the help of 15 researchers, &lt;a href=&quot;https://billionaireboard.com&quot;&gt;BillionaireBoard&lt;/a&gt; launches today as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The first open data-set on billionaires‚Äô donations &amp;amp; impact investments.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A monthly leaderboard to see who has been contributing the most recently.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An interactive movement where we, the public, can attempt to improve philanthropy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://billionaireboard.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;full&quot; src=&quot;/img/posts/billionaireboard.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it all starts with a focus on &lt;a href=&quot;https://billionaireboard.com/causes/covid-19&quot;&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the first pieces of the site were coming together, the coronavirus began to spread across the global and everything got quite a lot more real. While Governments proved too slow to solve the problem ahead-of-time, the first reports of Billionaires buying masks for hospitals came out. Then, as federal relief responses were stuck in Congress, some Billionaires began funding ventilator manufacturing and vaccine development. Lastly, as of today, it‚Äôs incredible to say that the world‚Äôs Billionaires have funded more COVID-19 scientific research than the CDC and NIH combined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that Billionaires are ‚Äúthe solution‚Äù ‚Äî just that they are already a major part of it, and clearly want to help. I believe that‚Äôs worth embracing and amplifying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus far, BillionaireBoard researchers have tracked that 17 billionaires have given or pledged about ~$1.88 billion dollars around the world to mitigate the pandemic, provide PPE to front-line health workers, and work on disease research. We‚Äôre still in the early days and expect more giving as the pandemic evolves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://billionaireboard.com&quot;&gt;https://billionaireboard.com&lt;/a&gt; and join today! You can click on each billionaire, learn about their focus areas, and encourage them to provide more funding. Each month the theme of the website will change so we, together, can encourage more types of philanthropy and investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-experiment&quot;&gt;An experiment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll say it now: my background isn‚Äôt in philanthropy, and I know achieving results is far more complex than putting a bit of data on a website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BillionaireBoard is an experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can we gather all of the data for all 2,200 billionaires?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can we actually accelerate philanthropy through transparency &amp;amp; helping identify new projects?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can we engage with billionaires and their foundations in a useful way?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope so. All we know so far is that Billionaires can make a difference with their wealth. They can help save lives, create innovation, and muster resources. They can convince local Governments to prevent outbreaks and jumpstart scientific advancement. Their immense power comes with great responsibility, and I hope we can all help them use it well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;want-to-help&quot;&gt;Want to help?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need help gathering more data! Today, BillionaireBoard partially covers ~30 billionaires, so there‚Äôs a lot of remaining ground to cover. Anyone can be a researcher by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/groups/billionaireboard&quot;&gt;joining our Facebook Group&lt;/a&gt; and contributing sourced data via ‚Äúpropose edit‚Äù buttons on Billionaire‚Äôs profiles. All data is verified for accuracy before being posted onto the live website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre a software developer, we have an API for submitting data! Let‚Äôs talk ‚Äî my email is below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, if you work for a billionaire or at a foundation, we‚Äôd be happy to give you access to ensure the accuracy of your data. You can email me at ztratar at gmail dot com.&lt;/p&gt;

                                <title>Balancing Organizations &amp; Oneself</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was at a tech event in San Francisco recently, a CEO was asked how they thought about balancing new initiatives with the core business, and their answer was simple but broadly applicable to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It struck me as particularly the type of advice one can only learn from experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;balancing-an-organization&quot;&gt;Balancing an organization&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All teams across an organization need resources. Most teams don‚Äôt have enough people for the goals they set out to achieve, and without these resources, some projects will fail. If your success has stemmed from a unique strategy that continues to win, how can you justify peeling useful resources away from it, and dooming it to a larger probability of failure in the name of new, unvalidated initiatives?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can imagine there are a bunch of ‚Äúgood‚Äù answers: analyzing opportunity-cost, finding new markets with higher growth rates, cultivating higher margin revenue streams, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the reality was more simple than analytical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the organization is doing too many things. When this is true, the product will often stagnate, sales people will report more losing deals, and teams will slow down. You will start to lose too many battles. This is obvious when it is starting to happen, and most in the organization ‚Äî especially leadership ‚Äî will have the strong, innate urge to focus resources. People don‚Äôt like to lose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, sometimes the organization isn‚Äôt doing enough things, and the larger, cash-cow teams will grow and grow until you see folks working on things that clearly aren‚Äôt critical ‚Äî they will become the metaphorical ‚Äúcog in the machine,‚Äù spinning because they‚Äôre supposed to, but going nowhere. In this scenario, especially in the technology industry, innovators in the company ‚Äî especially leadership ‚Äî will have the strong, innate urge to launch more impactful projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no necessary deeper analysis. Instead, the organization ‚Äî while it‚Äôs growing ‚Äî is naturally bouncing back and forth between two &lt;em&gt;feelings&lt;/em&gt;. And these feelings tend to be obvious, as long as people are honest with themselves and their teammates. Thus, striking a balance is about being aware of your feelings and the feelings of those around you. [0]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if no one feels strongly either way, then you‚Äôre probably sufficiently balanced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;balancing-yourself&quot;&gt;Balancing yourself&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I‚Äôve been thinking about this idea for a while, I think this approach is applicable to self-management as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we stumble around our life journeys, we often fail over and over again. Eventually, once we find something we‚Äôre kinda good at, we cling to it and it becomes a part of our routine &amp;amp; identity. Although continuous practice is a key to success, people often go overboard: they stick to what they find comfortable and close themselves off from new, potentially risky experiences. Discovering new skills, friendships, and responsibilities requires us to sacrifice our successful routines and identities in the face of likely discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how can we think about balancing our existing ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù routines with new experiences?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common analytical approach in life coaching is to leverage the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wheeloflife.noomii.com/&quot;&gt;‚ÄúWheel of Life‚Äù&lt;/a&gt;. With it, you rank your life in several various categories, and then create action plans to try new things in the areas you are weak. This works to an extent, but the method has many gaps [1]. Answering the question ‚Äúshould I try more things?‚Äù might be easier with an emotional approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people are trying too many things, they bounce around frantically, lose focus, and rarely make progress on bigger tasks/goals. So ask yourself: How do you feel about your progress as of late, and is that progress meaningful to your desired identity?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, when people don‚Äôt try enough new things, their chances of finding their innate passions, talents, and interests plummet. So ask yourself: How passionate do you feel, and how much have you discovered about yourself lately?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no necessary deeper analysis; you just have to be aware of your feelings. If you aren‚Äôt passionate (with or without progress), expose yourself to new experiences. If you are passionate, but feel as though you‚Äôre not making good progress, try fewer things and focus on that which is most important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre both passionate and making progress, congratulations, you‚Äôve probably found your balance!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Footnotes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[0] This has cultural implications. It‚Äôs a lot easier to balance an honest organization than one where people either ignore problems, or perceive everything as urgent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1] The Wheel of Life doesn‚Äôt account for identity, talents, or interests. The metrics only exist to force you to judge yourself relativistically.&lt;/p&gt;

                                <title>Training Motivation with a Slow Computer</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple years ago, I was reflecting on my life and realized something weird: for the first time in my life, I was unusually‚Ä¶ &lt;em&gt;organized&lt;/em&gt;. And not just with my physical world, but with my thoughts, plans &amp;amp; actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-sudden-change&quot;&gt;A Sudden Change&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This felt strange. I was never a particularly organized person. I never made my bed, left things out on kitchen counters, forgot dishes in the sink &lt;em&gt;(the most evil action of them all)&lt;/em&gt;, and let the mail pile up. Heck, if someone wants to contact me, that‚Äôs what email is for, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this chaos was normal for me, and when I thought of who I was, I had kind of accepted this lifestyle. It didn‚Äôt seem all that bad. I was doing ok. People care about this stuff too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So fast forward to my moment of reflection, and all of the sudden everything was‚Ä¶ mind-blowingly different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was different.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no eureka moment, no being ‚Äúfed up‚Äù with the mess, and no spur of insight. I honestly couldn‚Äôt explain what had changed or why it had changed, but I was definitely thinking differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of letting messes accumulate, I was defaulting to organization. I simply had the energy to do it, and I would do it. When I had a thought, I‚Äôd write it down and internalize it. Wonderfully, I felt like I was starting to truly understand myself as I would write things down, and that feeling created a feedback loop leading to more thoughts, more understanding, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recording my thoughts habitually into Evernote&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Journaling every now and then&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maintaining a to-do list, and crushing it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Working in sprints (3 hours on, 30 mins off)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Planning every month, week, and day down to the detail&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And more‚Ä¶&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never had a theory of why I changed, or how, until now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;was-i-accidentally-training-my-attention--willpower&quot;&gt;Was I accidentally training my attention &amp;amp; willpower?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After being recommended the book for the 10th time, I gave in and started to read ‚ÄúThinking Fast and Slow‚Äù by Dan Kahneman. In the book, Dan starts by highlighting numerous psychological studies &amp;amp; their often surprising results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these studies were later proven false, but to the best of my research the one I‚Äôm about to mention has retained validity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Dan &amp;amp; the team of researchers, attention and self-discipline are linked. Some people are naturally better at controlling their attention, and those people rank higher on many aptitude tests including those measuring intelligence. The most jarring thing though, for me, was that they all also tend to exhibit much higher rates of organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In subsequent tests, people were told to play video games that required them to continuously build upon their attention &amp;amp; self-discipline. Have you ever played Mario, and because you‚Äôre going for all-out speed, you make a silly mistake? Yeah, that‚Äôs the opposite of self-discipline in this scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people who played the game were able to increase their ability to stay focused throughout, and then those improvements &lt;em&gt;actually transferred over to other tasks&lt;/em&gt;. Those who played the games, and trained their attention, were able to perform better on the same aptitute tests they took prior to playing the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So where does this bring me? Was I playing a ton of games, or something? No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I was ‚Äî to an extremely stupid degree ‚Äî training my attention on accident. Like a game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;productivity-starts-with-a-slow-computer&quot;&gt;Productivity starts with a slow computer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my quest to build a startup company with very little money in the bank, I decided I couldn‚Äôt afford a shiny, new computer. I had a 2010 Macbook Air, which sounds fine, but the damn thing‚Äôs battery was so bad it had to be plugged in at all times. Worse, the CPU would constantly clock down thinking it was going to run out of battery, and everything would move at about ~20% speed every other minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, these were some of the most productive days I ever had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I would sit their coding or designing, the actual movements on the screen, such as my cursor, would lag for seconds. I would sit there and wait, see the result, take another action, and then wait again. It was absurd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I‚Äôd show my friends some piece of code, and they‚Äôd see the computer running as god-awfully slow as it was, they would freak out at me and be amazed I was getting anything done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But again, these were probably the most productive days of my entire life!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I sat there waiting ‚Äî praying ‚Äî for the computer to do it‚Äôs job and compute things for me, I‚Äôd never hit alt+tab to check Facebook. I literally couldn‚Äôt: alt-tabbing would have made it take 30 seconds longer. While my app was compiling and logs were streaming, I‚Äôd just sit there staring at the little black box produce text. I remember it feeling very meditative. I didn‚Äôt feel the need to multi-task because I simply couldn‚Äôt. When the app had finished compiling, I‚Äôd quietly ‚Äì albeit slowly ‚Äì get back in the productivity game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What‚Äôs Next&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, my computer runs fast. When my apps are building, you can bet I‚Äôm awkwardly attempting to multi-task &amp;amp; open up a new tab in chrome. My habit of appreciating the slow has faded, and honestly, so has much of the feeling of internal organization. I‚Äôm genuinely worse at writing down my thoughts habitually, expounding them in detail, and feeling like I know myself (in general). I clean my apartment regularly-&lt;em&gt;ish&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I‚Äôm going to use this potential new insight to try and go slower again, and just see what that does. As stupid as it sounds, this is going to be way more difficult this time around‚Ä¶ since my computer is fast.&lt;/p&gt;

                                <title>Maxims &amp;amp; Inspiration</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;Even though Spock fans would disagree, we‚Äôre all guided by our emotions. When they arise through passion, we can channel them to produce and create wonderous things. When our emotions dull or lower, we have a natural inclination to dwell and despair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I began thinking about this, I grew curious. Could a routine help reinforce productive emotions and truly mitigate ‚Äì not just ignore ‚Äì the reverse?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that emotions have two primary sources: preceding emotions and logical deductions. If we believe ourselves to be in a position of greatness, it is easy to get excited and attempt to manifest such a position. If one tells us we are incapable of something or that our ideas have no merit, we question our own capability and reinforce that belief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;External happenstances that guide our emotions are unavoidable. Some may consider that to be a bit scary, but we all have a powerful tool to fight the good fight: internal dialogue! With our own thought, we all occasionally have epiphanies ‚Äì small and large ‚Äì that makes us &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; good. And we should feel good; we just figured something out! Go team!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But where do these epiphanies come from and once we have them and how often do they really stick with us? I found that I rarely kept track of mine and, as a result, kept asking myself the same questions over and over again. These epiphanies are logical in nature and wildly differ from person to person, but they certainly affect emotions. Since logic can be re-stated time and time again, perhaps we can use it to our advantage and guide ourselves towards a consistently healthy state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;its-called-a-maxim&quot;&gt;It‚Äôs called a Maxim!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You‚Äôve probably heard either the terms ‚ÄúMaxim‚Äù or ‚ÄúProverb‚Äù before. They mean the same thing: a short statement of truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúLife is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated.‚Äù - Confucious&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúVery little is is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself, in your way of thinking.‚Äù - Marcus Aurelius&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúYou have power over your mind ‚Äî not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.‚Äù - Marcus Aurelius&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius, Emperor of Rome, is considered to be one of the wisest men to have ever lived, but even he realized his own weaknesses. So what did he do? He set up a daily routine to battle them. Upon waking, Marcus would recite his own personalized maxims and ponder their meaning; these were quick refreshers that helped guide the rest of his day, week, month, and year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;modern-society-and-me&quot;&gt;Modern Society and Me&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that modern society prioritizes sources of inspiration in a completely backwards manner: ease-of-discovery dominates efficacy. People hang inspirational posters, collect items on Pinterest, and even go searching for the oh-so-loved ‚Äúlike‚Äù on social networks. We look for small glimmers of social proof and meaning through luck ‚Äî we think ‚Äúperhaps the outside world holds the same things to be true as my inner self!‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much time does that leave for us to focus and reflect upon our own thoughts? Not enough, in my opinion, and oh what a shame! We understand ourselves better than anyone else, which means we &lt;em&gt;resonate with our own, personal discoveries the most!&lt;/em&gt; What would it mean to you if you had an essentially unlimited, effective source of inspiration? We can create sources of daily inspiration that are targeted towards our most foundational of needs, optimized for our current state of life, and ‚Äî most importantly ‚Äî &lt;em&gt;guide us specifically towards who we want to be&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although cute, no kitten on a tree that says ‚Äúhang in there‚Äù is going to prove comparable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did a little experiment and pushed myself to create a couple maxims every week. As I set aside 15 minutes every morning to go over my own list and think in peace, I found the benefits to be immediete and immense. Just like starting the day with a win by making my bed, I‚Äôve found that I feel more able and positive when I calibrate my thoughts. It makes small problems stay small ‚Äî or at least &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; small ‚Äî and become more manageable. Oh, and it makes even the smallest of wins fit into a larger framework, which means their value isn‚Äôt simply forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it helped me, I thought I‚Äôd share with everyone who might be interested and end up reading this. Here are a couple things I‚Äôve learned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It takes repetition. If not every day, every other day seems to be nearly as effective (but there‚Äôs definitely a difference).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You‚Äôll eventually have a large list of maxims if you keep at it. As you keep creating, also focus on condensing any overlapping points. It needs to remains clear and concise‚Ä¶ which brings me to the next point.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creating your own maxims helps you understand a little bit more about yourself. Answering ‚ÄúWho am I?‚Äù becomes quite a bit easier, and the result more vivid.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Targeting your current emotional state when reflecting is really effective. Just lose a battle? Focus on the war.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a proponent of Science, I also want to note that none of this was scientific in the slightest. Shoot me a tweet if you‚Äôre thinking about trying this out; I‚Äôd love to hear about your discoveries!&lt;/p&gt;

                                <title>Followr V1: New Features and Insights</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;http://zachtratar.com/followr.html&quot;&gt;wrote about&lt;/a&gt; and launched Followr two weeks ago, a chrome extension designed to help people gain traction on twitter through automated means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was truly surprised by people‚Äôs reactions. I expected to be crushed by the community, but nearly everyone was kind and positive.  Oh ‚Äì there was one person who called me mentally delusional. &lt;em&gt;Thanks, stranger!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I received so much great feedback that I decided to act quickly. Today, I‚Äôm releasing Followr v1.0.0, the 2nd public release. You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://ztratar.github.io/followr&quot;&gt;download it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-features-in-v1&quot;&gt;New Features In V1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History &amp;amp; Conversion Tracking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now see what actions Followr is taking in the ‚ÄúHistory‚Äù page. When favorites convert into followers, the specific tweet is marked as ‚ÄúConverted!‚Äù You can also see your total gained followers from Followr on the ‚ÄúSetup‚Äù page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Granular Control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most requested features was a blacklist, and so it came to be. Followr will never favorite tweets that contain words in the blacklist. Multi-word search queries were also returning poorly relevant results, so Followr now searches for exact query strings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved Interface &amp;amp; Tutorial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous interface was missing a lot of highly relevant information. The new tutorial guides and informs new users. The extension popout now shows you which account Followr is using. I rebuilt the entire interface front the ground up, so pictures will do more justice than words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;full&quot; src=&quot;/img/posts/followrV1/setup-tab.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;full&quot; src=&quot;/img/posts/followrV1/history-tab.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;full&quot; src=&quot;/img/posts/followrV1/progress.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stealth / Anti-Detection Improvements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opening up Followr would previously append a ?followr=true variable to the window ‚Äî lame. Followr now uses script injection to control Twitter‚Äôs native frontend controls. The time interval that dictates when Followr runs has also been randomized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-whats-next&quot;&gt;So, what‚Äôs next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is still much work to be done and Followr is open-source, so let me know if you want to help out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Query Effectiveness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I‚Äôm satisfied with the interface and basic favoriting mechanisms, I want to make fewer actions convert into more followers. To do this, the search queries will be optimized using previous data. I would probably be able to do a better job on this if I centralized some data, but I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs a good choice. Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code Cleanup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I admittedly fell into callback hell. The code could use a good ol‚Äô refactoring to become squeaky clean. I‚Äôm thinking about implementing the next version using Promises, which would be quite fun. The CSS is also getting quite gross ‚Äî I‚Äôll switch over to LESS &amp;amp; Grunt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-lovely-reviews&quot;&gt;Some lovely reviews&lt;/h2&gt;

                                <title>Popcorn Time And Tech's Duty To Do The Right Thing</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When I first started writing this post, I didn‚Äôt know where it would end up. This post covers many topics ‚Äî maybe too many ‚Äî so I want to emphasize one thing right now: the last section means the most to me. If you‚Äôre only going to read for 15-20 seconds, please skip to the last section. Thanks, Zach.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-apathy&quot;&gt;My Apathy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I vividly remember the first time I used Napster. I was 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My cousin and I were playing video games when his older sister began to play a new Blink-182 song on her computer. I ran over to check it out and saw a blue download bar moving at speeds I had never seen - turns out my Uncle had just bought a T1 internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My cousin and I stayed up all night downloading music illegally. We didn‚Äôt know any better. We had only a faint idea of copyright law and this program, so readily accessible, surely didn‚Äôt &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; bad. Bad things are hard to do, &lt;em&gt;right?&lt;/em&gt; Plus, this was fun! Bad things can‚Äôt be fun, &lt;em&gt;right?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I stopped downloading and torrenting files years ago, I was never truly disturbed by pirating. I didn‚Äôt like the idea of taking someones work for free, but my disdain wasn‚Äôt at a level where I felt like I wanted to say anything, let alone take action. When I watched Governments destroy the lives of The Pirate Bay creators, I vilified the Governments. If my friend loaded up a torrent to stream on a projector, I wouldn‚Äôt think twice‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd just go in the kitchen and make some popcorn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;popcorn-time&quot;&gt;Popcorn Time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was shown Popcorn Time a couple weeks ago and my mind was subsequently blown. Popcorn Time was beautiful ‚Äî it was the first beautiful pirating application I had ever seen. I could search for nearly any movie and have it playing in a matter of seconds with two clicks. This was something my Mom could use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time, in that brief moment of realization, I felt scared ‚Äî even sorry ‚Äî for the media industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As they say, with great power comes great responsibility. Popcorn Time is too good at what it does. I know where to draw the line for my own uses of technology, but most ten year olds, for example, aren‚Äôt going to give a shit. Nothing easy and fun can be that bad, &lt;em&gt;right?&lt;/em&gt; They‚Äôre going to download and download until one day, their parents finally ask ‚ÄúHey, what is that?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, you know, ‚Äúit‚Äôs just this app where I can get any movie for free!‚Äù Many parents won‚Äôt know any better. The kids will install it for them, skip the fear-provoking warning screen, and move the entire, blissfully ignorant family into torrenting territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This territory has been historically small due to the illicit nature of piracy and its accompanying environment. Back in the early 2000s, Napster, Limewire, and Kazaa were distribution machines for not only music, but also computer viruses. If people didn‚Äôt weren‚Äôt technically savvy, they were likely to download something stupid and brick their computer. Many people chose to not run the risk. The suspect conditions surrounding piracy still live today; most torrenting sites are plastered with porn ads and get-rich-quick schemes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with all of these things preventing piracy, over half of all Americans have admitted to partaking. Half ‚Äî that‚Äôs a lot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.dailytech.com/nimage/Piracy_Percentages_Wide.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remove the unpleasing experience from piracy and what can happen? Popcorn Time will not be the last application open this door. It has proven that you can layer a great, seemingly clean experience on top of an illicit foundation. They‚Äôve shown that doing so can result in a flock of people wanting more ‚Äî after all, everyone needs to save money in these tough times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt know how many people would use something like Popcorn Time, but I think the number could be extraordinarily high ‚Äî so high that it may not only do significant damage, but also shake the media industry into a partial collapse. I don‚Äôt want that to happen. The media industry creates beautiful pieces of artwork that help inspire and define generations. It enables dreams and floods people with shared imaginations in a sometimes otherwise dark world. It‚Äôs an important asset for this nation and the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-media-industry&quot;&gt;The Media Industry&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The media industry knows they need to adapt to continue making money, but how should they adapt? It‚Äôs a difficult question to answer, so let‚Äôs get some perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire music industry, for example, is not massive ‚Äî overall revenue last year was only $16.5 billion. WhatsApp, a single company, sold for $19 billion to Facebook last month. The kingpins of media are attempting to protect their revenue streams to the best of their abilities and they see piracy as their primary enemy. With limited capital, the best means of exerting power is through‚Ä¶ you guessed it, Government!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for them (and us), they don‚Äôt collectively understand technology. Every attempt they make to fix copyright protection results in proposed legislation that tramples internet freedom. I think there are many people in tech who would be on their side if real compromise was put on the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As ineffective as the media industry may be at proposing such compromise, I‚Äôm also seeing apathy from tech industry leadership. We constantly put the ball in the media industry‚Äôs court to create legislation before we say ‚ÄúNo! That sucks too!‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So again, &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; should they adapt?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may be controversial, but I don‚Äôt think they possess the abilities to cleanly save themselves. If they‚Äôre on their own, I believe there will be collateral damage. Internet freedom will continually be in the crosshairs, albeit unnecessary, if the media industry doesn‚Äôt get help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the goals for the media industry are pretty clear, so why doesn‚Äôt the tech industry give it a shot?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legislation that hits a good middle ground is possible if and only if the right people are working on it. I think the leaders of the tech industry need to to go the extra mile, work with Hollywood, and spearhead their own version of fresh, internet-preserving copyright protection law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;doing-the-right-thing&quot;&gt;Doing The Right Thing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just ranted about the media industry ‚Äî can these same concepts be generalized? Should they be? Let‚Äôs think philosophically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology possesses great power ‚Äî the likes of which are being scrutinized by the world. Who are these techies on buses? Why can‚Äôt I afford rent anymore? Why are robots replacing hard-working people in factories?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As technology moves forward, it is inevitable that it will grow in both good and bad ways. ‚ÄúSoftware is eating the world‚Äù ‚Äî think about that sentence for the second. To engineers it is a rallying cry for beautiful efficiency, to others it sounds flat out horrifying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôre all human. Transition is extremely hard ‚Äî it is emotionally draining upon individuals and society. For technology to make the most optimal impact, it must be smooth and welcomed, its benefits clear as day and its intentions unquestionably pure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People should be uniting around Science and Technology, not against it. Technology must be viewed as something magical instead of malicious. It is so easy for technology, computing especially, to seem cold, self-interested, and reckless; making it friendly, warm, and benevolent will take effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology has enabled piracy to flip the media industry upside down and that is just the beginning. Very soon, technology will start having more pronounced effects on labor and manufacturing through 3D printing and the internet of things. We won‚Äôt be talking about piracy and media then, we‚Äôll be talking about millions of jobs and economic conditions never studied in recorded history. As a whole, our quest for innovation must be balanced with careful wisdom and ‚Äî I‚Äôll say it ‚Äî an appreciation for the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We cannot enact change that affects billions of lives and then say ‚Äúfend for yourself, figure out the new rules‚Äù. I believe we must hold out our hands, share   a vision for what is newly possible, and, most importantly, show people what role they can play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is in our ability ‚Äî &lt;em&gt;no ones else‚Äôs&lt;/em&gt;, and thus I believe it is our duty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to my friends for feedback on this post: Andrew Chapello, Andrew Hsu, Peter Pelberg, and Mustafa Khan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                                <title>Followr, Twitter Bots, and Ethical Considerations</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;Twitter has a massive problem: new users have an extremely difficult time getting started. People who give it a chance and invest real time into the network usually fizzle out after a couple days, leaving without a clue as to what makes it great. Case in point: I now consider myself an active Twitter user, though it took 6 tries and 5 years to finally ‚Äòget it‚Äô. Oh, and I‚Äôm in the frigin‚Äô tech industry!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you join Twitter you have no followers ‚Äî it‚Äôs like being brought into an empty room and being told ‚Äúhave fun!‚Äù Even though you can stare at a wall for 2 minutes before leaving, the average person is going to leave a heck of a lot quicker. You can import your friends and contacts lists, but that‚Äôs a long shot ‚Äì chances are those people aren‚Äôt using Twitter either. For people to follow you, you need to fill out a fancy bio, tweet some interesting things, and hope people find you by luck. Oh, but Twitter‚Äôs sign up process must help‚Ä¶ right? Wrong. It tells you to follow influencers, the people who are least likely to listen to what you have to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these barriers hit you in the face before you derive any value from the product. I believe Twitter has a potential thousands of times greater than its current footprint, but it has to fix this problem. Until it does, I believe helping them out a bit to be a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;opportunity-in-the-depths&quot;&gt;Opportunity In The Depths&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beauty of Twitter is its simple architecture. There is a lot you can do with it; even though the default functionality is lacking, we can make it better ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can we make Twitter better? I think there can be many pieces to this puzzle and now is the time to get creative. One of the best solutions I‚Äôve found lies in the most controversial of places: automation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every ‚Äútraditional‚Äù twitter bot I‚Äôve seen was written with two goals in mind: First, to avoid detection and second, to gain followers in vast numbers. Absolutely everything else is at the expense of these two goals, and thus, bots tarnish the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That got me thinking, could you make a bot that truly enhances the network?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I asked around, many people seemed to have a vendetta against all automation within social networks. I think this is due to historically poor bot design. Automation itself is not bad, but is in fact critical to the effectiveness of all modern applications. Certain tasks simply suit themselves towards automation: email newsletters, notification clustering, information collection and analysis, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter bots can take many types of actions, including following and then unfollowing users, auto-replying, and favoriting tweets. All of these actions are disingenuous, favoriting being the least. That‚Äôs the negative. The positive lies with the cold, hard fact that favoriting tweets gets you followers ‚Äî the same possible followers you likely need as a new user to make Twitter useful. So what if you could outweigh the negative with the positive?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introducing-followr&quot;&gt;Introducing Followr&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I‚Äôm releasing a little project called &lt;a href=&quot;http://ztratar.github.io/followr&quot;&gt;Followr&lt;/a&gt; to the public. Followr is a Twitter bot, pure and simple, but it aims to be very different than the status quo in three ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Instead of being a menace to the Twitter ecosystem, &lt;strong&gt;Followr‚Äôs goal is to be the first truly tasteful bot&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äî the first bot designed to actually help holistically improve Twitter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Followr is open-source&lt;/strong&gt;. I‚Äôll be happy if others pitch in to make it even better.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Followr is a chrome extension. It uses the native Twitter website as a proxy to work its magic, so &lt;strong&gt;it can‚Äôt be shut down with ease&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between Followr and traditional Twitter bots lies in the net value created. A tasteful bot does vastly more good than harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be lying if I said Followr is a ‚Äòpure‚Äô tool. The truth is that results matter more: Followr makes Twitter a more friendly, usable network. It enables more people to discover you through shared interests. It can theoretically help give a voice to every individual whose at an unfair advantage because they came to the game late. I sincerely hope it can help you as it has helped the others I started it for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-it-work-how-will-it-work&quot;&gt;How does it work, how will it work?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first version, released today, has minimal functionality. It takes a list of topics you like, searches for tweets about them, and favorites a couple of them. Whereas traditional bots favorite a massive amount of tweets and spam, Followr only favorites 12 or so tweets every 30 minutes your browser is open. For Twitter members with high follower counts this won‚Äôt do much, but for those new to the system it can make the experience. Followr also rewards you with more favorites when you interact with others through legitimate discussions and retweets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though much improvement is still possible, after observing the habits of users, I‚Äôve found that Followr, in its current form, creates a net positive value. I think it could made substantially more effective by implementing and improving in some key areas, such as the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligent Tweet Selection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some automatically favorited tweets will resonate with you while others won‚Äôt. A better bot can increase the number of the former and minimize the latter, making the favorites more valuable and giving you better connections with better people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better Behavior Driven Rewards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning on Followr and never going back to Twitter would be a terrible thing. This is why Followr should learn your behavior over time and reward you for doing good. If you use Twitter like a bot, Followr should ideally shut itself off. There are many ideas that can be explored in this vertical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analytics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many people followed me organically vs Followr? Right now, the analytics for that answer aren‚Äôt built. Followr can‚Äôt do some basic things, like give weighted priority to one topic over another or check if you‚Äôre already followed by a user it‚Äôs favoriting. It also has a severe ‚Äúpretty graph‚Äù deficiency, which most certainly requires a remedy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whatever you can think up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have an idea? We can talk about it on Github Issues or on Twitter! Shoot me a tweet &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/zachtratar&quot;&gt;@zachtratar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some will disagree with this approach and that‚Äôs ok. I know it‚Äôs a tad controversial, but I find it naive to deem good automation impossible. It can be done. Since Followr is a chrome extension, it will auto-update on people‚Äôs browsers as improvements are created. I‚Äôm excited to what the future holds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ztratar.github.io/followr&quot;&gt;You can download Followr here&lt;/a&gt;. If you like it, please review it! Don‚Äôt like it? I‚Äôm all ears.&lt;/p&gt;

                                <title>My Reply To Senator Feinstein</title>
                                <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dianne Feinstein, Senator for California and Head of the Intelligence committee, just sent out an email supporting the NSA surveillance programs. I put her email in the comments section and the PDF she attached can be found &lt;a href=&quot;/files/Feinstein-Chronicle.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to read the full text. This is my reply.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senator Feinstein,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all due respect, the beginning line in your second paragraph has already been proven untrue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúFirst, please be assured that the NSA does not conduct mass surveillance on U.S. citizens.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is well known now that the NSA conducts varies degrees of dragnet data collection. If you are limiting the definition of surveillance to only information that is being looked at &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; by human eyes, then you would be correct. I believe that dragnet data collection is surveillance. My actions, my words, my emotions ‚Äì everything ‚Äì is collected. It may not be scrutinized now, but it can be scrutinized later. Any such program removes ones freedom to act ‚Äì people act different when watched. Usually for the better, I‚Äôll admit, but that is certainly not for the Government to decide. The Sedition acts of the 1800s are a prime example, and I believe this to be of equivalent importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Americans need liberty. The world needs liberty. It is a constitutional requirement that my liberty be protected, and unfortunately, I see it slipping away week by week as select people claim there is no surveillance. How far will you go to fight for my liberty?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only ask one thing: please ensure you understand the issue from this perspective ‚Äì the perspective where definitions are a bit more cloudy than Merriam-Webster. The perspective where pure data collection is a form of surveillance and must be stopped in all forms of dragnet operation. When you vote or propose legislation moving in that direction, you re-affirm a vote from me and thousands of others. When you vote for dragnet data collection, you are voting to limit liberty in all its forms ‚Äì the antithesis of American pride and power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Precedent is important and I understand the kind of position you‚Äôre in is not only complicated, but career-threatening. As the head of the Intelligence community, it may seem that many advocates promoting the same things as me aren‚Äôt listening to your side. That might be true, but I sincerely hope that doesn‚Äôt lead towards an overall generalization clouding the righteous passions of many citizens. That would be a travesty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want my children to live in a United States of America that promotes peace and, instead of pushing forward the status quo of ‚Äúus vs them‚Äù and ‚Äúterrorists are inherently evil at birth‚Äù, does its best to resolve these issues through intelligent foreign policy and humanitarian aid. I want to live in an America that is a shining city on top of a hill ‚Äì one that strives to take the high road at every possible moment. Terrorism is a tricky issue ‚Äì the issue of the century ‚Äì but it cannot be solved by brute force means. Terrorism is deep-seated anger, hate, and revenge. It is irrational, yet that doesn‚Äôt mean it has to be fought with irrational or impure means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The founding fathers said that freedom is achievable when liberty is balanced with order. I believe strongly in order, but we also must try different approaches to achieve it and hold each program underneath a spotlight that ranks effectiveness and efficiency. The net loses for Americans through the NSA programs severely outweigh the benefits we derive if, and only if we can maintain order and security through other means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are these other means? I‚Äôd like different answers explored through our great legislative and governmental processes. Please make that happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a good day,
Zach&lt;/p&gt;

                                <title>What I'm Grateful For</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of my friends recently shared a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHv6vTKD6lg&amp;amp;feature=c4-overview-vl&amp;amp;list=PLzvRx_johoA8PC6S5k5S2SszRQOR8oSEa&quot;&gt;great video about gratitude&lt;/a&gt; and how it correlates with one‚Äôs own happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was driving home last night when I started thinking about this video again. I thought: what am I grateful for? Quite ironically, right when this thought popped in my mind some jagoff cut me off and nearly hit a Prius to my right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not very grateful for that guy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in all seriousness, time to list off some great stuff:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am grateful for genuine people.&lt;/strong&gt; It‚Äôs too damned easy to get caught up in fake facades and societal expectations these days. People who challenge this social status quo and simply represent their true selves are the most beautiful of all.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am grateful to be in a world and nation rich in infrastructure.&lt;/strong&gt; The modern world is amazing. For those lucky enough to be born with access to the internet, modern transportation, complex resource distribution systems, etc, the world is quite literally our playground. We can learn whatever we want, do whatever we want, say whatever we want ‚Äì build whatever we want. Modern infrastructure has given us the means to attain a level of individual liberty unattainable by our ancestors. Sure, it also comes with societal expectations and imperfect systems, but I think those are merely bumps on a long road; they can be overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am grateful for the people, both modern and ancient, who built the infrastructure of the world.&lt;/strong&gt; This includes everyone ‚Äì not just the CEOs of the olden days. I didn‚Äôt invent the car, but I get to drive one. I didn‚Äôt discover electricity, but I get to show you this set of words because millions of electrons move in unison. I didn‚Äôt have to fight for civil rights, but I get to have friends of multiple cultures and races. Every single thing we know and use on this planet was discovered or created by someone just like us. Each invention and piece of forward progress started as as small idea in someone‚Äôs mind and grew into something grand. Even though so many problems still exist, so many have been solved. Mad props, old timers!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am grateful for everyone fighting to make tomorrow better than today.&lt;/strong&gt; The world presents us many opportunities and it‚Äôs not easy to determine how impactful our role truly is. Being self-critical in this environment and taking action to ensure your in the right place requires bravery, pure and simple.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And onto some of the personal stuff:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am grateful to have such a loving family.&lt;/strong&gt; It‚Äôs always wonderful to talk to my mom, cousins, aunts and uncles. They‚Äôre great people and whenever I chat with any of them I feel like I‚Äôm home.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am grateful to have the best friends in the world.&lt;/strong&gt; You all are frigin‚Äô rockstars and have helped me in so many ways.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am grateful to live in one of the most beautiful locations I‚Äôve ever known.&lt;/strong&gt; The sunrise peering over the mountains in the bay makes all morning commutes irrationally energizing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am grateful to have an awesome set of colleagues.&lt;/strong&gt; Having managed so many parts of a large recruiting process, I‚Äôm reminded all the time how unique and rare it is to have this group around me and fighting for the same mission.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am grateful to be working on something that is truly meaningful.&lt;/strong&gt; It‚Äôs all about bringing people together in ways they didn‚Äôt believe were possible‚Ä¶ helping people find their true home. Home sweet home!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What are you grateful for? I‚Äôd like to know if you‚Äôre willing to
share. Tweet it at me below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                                <title>PRISM: A Final Blow To Functioning Democracy?</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;In the unlikely chance you found yourself here and have no idea who Ed Snowden is, you need to watch this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2013/jun/09/nsa-whistleblower-edward-snowden-interview-video&quot;&gt;12-minute interview&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don‚Äôt have time? Seriously try and make time. If you care at all about your privacy or the principles upon which America was founded, watch it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prism&quot;&gt;PRISM&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The single primary document Ed Snowden leaked outlines an NSA program called ‚ÄúPRISM‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through all of the speculation, it seems the most likely scenario is that PRISM is a data-collection utility. It connects the NSA internal database to specialized, intermediary servers within companies that provide communication services. This includes Google, Facebook, Verizon, Yahoo, AT&amp;amp;T, Apple, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôve been hearing the Government say over and over that PRISM and these data tools do not ‚Äútarget‚Äù American citizens, but according to Edward Snowden the system ‚Äúingests everyone by default.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woah! Those are definitely contradictory statments. Who do we believe? This answer is determined by how we define ‚Äútarget‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs well known amongst the startup and data communities that you want to track almost everything since data storage is cheap. It‚Äôs a best practice. Dig a little deeper into news sources and it‚Äôs easy to determine that the NSA does, in fact, ingest everything about you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ‚Äútargeting‚Äù language being used by the White House most likely implies how they &lt;em&gt;analyze&lt;/em&gt; the data. But again, it‚Äôs never best practice to simply ignore recorded data. Instead, depending on what you‚Äôre tracking, you‚Äôll just weight data patterns you‚Äôre looking for. Turns out that &lt;em&gt;no one&lt;/em&gt; is exempt from this analysis! The White House claims it does not target Americans simply because they &lt;em&gt;attempt&lt;/em&gt; to only look for foreigners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is a catch: their attempts are failing! Their algorithm to determine whether or not a person is a foreigner only has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.informationweek.com/security/privacy/nsa-prism-inside-the-modern-surveillance/240156341&quot;&gt;51% confidence interval&lt;/a&gt;. Just under half the people analyzed by their software are, in fact, American citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we know we‚Äôre being recorded and likely analyzed, let‚Äôs jump into the high level of what this all means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-fall-of-functioning-democracy&quot;&gt;The Fall of Functioning Democracy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History tends to repeat itself as complex sociological and governmental patterns emerge. Even as far &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato's_five_regimes&quot;&gt;back as Plato&lt;/a&gt;, there have been theorized cycles for governmental systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although history tends to show that true democracy performs the best, it ‚Äì like everything ‚Äì also has its weaknesses. There aren‚Äôt many huge points-of-failure in the system, but instead thousands of smaller vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With no strong influence or unified government to cover these holes, spreading power can create a slowing of decision-making, inefficiencies in process, and thus both instability and mistrust. Instability leads to a populace that craves security, and as security increases over time, it almost always falls into tyranny. The founding fathers knew this, which led them to say things like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThose who surrender freedom for security will not have, nor do they deserve, either one.‚Äù - Benjamin Franklin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This nation was founded upon the primary ideal of freedom. You as a citizen must never passively nor actively be hindered from thinking, acting, and speaking your mind. A functional democracy requires its populace to be both absolutely free and well-informed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We the people ‚Äì we who are entrusted to properly vote in the best legislators ‚Äì are not informed in the slightest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US Government‚Äôs document classification system was originally created to protect documents that would, if released, harm national security. Unfortunately, it is frequently used to hide unpopular and apparently unconstitutional policies. If people do not have access to this critical information, then they, by definition, cannot be informed to the extent required to make intelligent voting decisions. Instead, the NSA has given themselves a ‚Äúself-certification that they serve the national interest.‚Äù That doesn‚Äôt sound like democracy to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I ask you a question: what does it take to speak your mind? What if it‚Äôs controversial?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Psychologically, if someone is listening to you and can theoretically use information against you, you are less likely to speak. At that point, &lt;em&gt;you are no longer free&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even if you think you have nothing to hide, &lt;a href=&quot;http://kottke.org/13/06/you-commit-three-felonies-a-day&quot;&gt;think again&lt;/a&gt;. The justice system doesn‚Äôt always play nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I know you‚Äôre thinking ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll still never come after me‚Äù. But in that logic lies a tricky problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-we-should-all-care&quot;&gt;Why We Should All Care&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cat is now out of the bag. The public now &lt;em&gt;knows&lt;/em&gt; that the US government is running PRISM-like surveillance programs. Before the leak, using data from programs like this to jail or suppress any individuals‚Äô freedoms would entail high risk. The program could be exposed to the public and the intelligence agency would be under fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But using the data now is far less risky and will thus be used more often. If we allow governmental programs such as PRISM to exist, then we give the intelligence community the go-ahead to use this data in public forum, however that may evolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can‚Äôt predict the future, but someone among the NSA will eventually think about building an API on top of it; someone will think about making the data decentralized; someone will think about making it universally accessible. We are on an extremely slippery slope. Edward Snowden spoke up because he believed that if he didn‚Äôt, our losses as a public would be ‚Äúirrevocable‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irrevocable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This word truly means a lot because it is &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; used when describing software. Snowden himself stated that if he wanted to break down many of the NSA‚Äôs systems, he could. PRISM included, considering his unfettered access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is this irrevocable system? I think that the NSA is about to finish a new, highly advanced data collection/analysis system ‚Äì one that makes PRISM and the other leaked systems look like children‚Äôs toys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With their non-democratic self-certification, the NSA is going to continue ingesting every piece of data is can get its hand on. All of your data in one place. It will be spread across numerous locations and have multiple backups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once that information is put into the system, it will never cease-to-exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyber-warfare and complex system intrusions are becoming increasingly common. We cannot build perfect security systems ‚Äì new flaws in seemingly-impervious systems are found all of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When, &lt;em&gt;not if&lt;/em&gt;, there is a massive data leak, what will happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ‚Äúthey‚Äôll still never come after me‚Äù mentality is now completely moot; we don‚Äôt even know who ‚Äúthey‚Äù are. Maybe it‚Äôs an identity thief; maybe it‚Äôs a foreign government ‚Äì it could be &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our government is taking these actions in the name of security, but effectively all we‚Äôre doing is stockpiling ammo, 99.9% of which can only be shot back at ourselves. We then put that ammo behind a shoddy wall for safekeeping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite obviously, this does not make us more secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are we sure we want to live in that world? Are we sure our children and grand-children will want to live in that world?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs completely possible that we are making that choice right now.&lt;/p&gt;
