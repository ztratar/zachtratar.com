                                <title>Disinformation: The Game of Belief is now a War</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;A mass hijacking of our minds is currently underway. Perhaps you’ve felt it for a while now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underlying facts seem increasingly rare, “the truth” is debated back and forth without progress, and people’s behaviors continuously bend towards the irrational. It’s all so weirdly ironic — aren’t we supposed to be living in the so-called “Information Age”?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the heck happened?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, we’re all human &amp;amp; sometimes believe in things that aren’t true. It’s a complicated psychological weakness — after all, “what is truth” is a hard question! As we seek truth as individuals, we’re lucky that most of our personal misjudgments are unique and relatively harmless. At scale, however, people have learned our psychology becomes predictable. And exploitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individuals and organizations — especially the media, political parties and politicians — above all seek to increase their power and status. Thus, in their communication, their primary goal is not to tell the truth or describe reality, but instead to win the game they are playing. This incentive leads them to build their audience by engaging in disinformation campaigns and “&lt;em&gt;Narrative Warfare”&lt;/em&gt; tactics&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; They create stories &amp;amp; perceptions — some real, some fake — to manipulate our emotions and align us with &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; narrative &amp;amp; &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information, reality, and truth… none of them really matter as long as we end up joining their side and reinforcing their power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although mass manipulation is a trend throughout all of history, it turns out that giving everyone smartphones and instant access to every other human &lt;em&gt;changes everything&lt;/em&gt;. The internet is jet fuel. Through Facebook and online media, disinformation now spreads to millions within minutes, is targeted to the specific people who will believe it, and evolves social groups to purge skeptics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, these attacks on our information ecosystem turn many people into fact-resistant conspiracy theorists and radicals — their identity and daily thoughts become dominated by a tribal battles they believe they are fighting. Once enough people radicalize, Politicians need their votes and are forced to radicalize as well to get elected. Finally, the cycle completes: once in power, politicians opt to accelerate Narrative Warfare to reinforce their power instead of summoning the courage to lead. This is what we have seen play out in the US over the past decade and it’s a downward spiral we must reverse. It threatens the core foundations of successful democracy: empathy, collaboration, useful debate, and truthful speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zachtratar.com/voter-fraud-debunk.html#.YBcYCelKjUI&quot;&gt;I’ve met these politicians&lt;/a&gt; and observed these social patterns. From 2008 to 2010 I founded a political polling company and learned how political parties didn’t just want your data — they wanted to know who your family was, how to convince you of things, and which buttons to push. I got out of politics. Then, from 2011 to 2014 I was the first employee at a well-funded social media startup. We walked into the office every day desiring to “create community”, and even though some of us were educated in psychology, we were totally naive. No where in our heads did we imagine the acceleration of misinformation and disinformation at scale. While we only reached millions of people, Facebook successfully spread to billions and doubled-down on exploitable technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now we’re all living in manipulated realities, attacking each other on a daily basis, and often resorting to conspiratorial thinking. To get out of this, we all have a responsibility to grow wiser to “truth”, mitigate tribalism and take back control of our minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let’s start by better understanding the war we’re in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;table-of-contents&quot;&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Complexity of Truth&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Psychology of Truth&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Group Dynamics of Truth&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Societal Truth&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Game of Belief&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Narrative Warfare&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Technological Acceleration&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What Next?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;complexity-of-truth&quot;&gt;Complexity of Truth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We attempt to determine truth as individuals by making judgements, and these judgements are all based on information we encounter in various forms (e.g. school, books, facebook posts, conversations, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truth is complex and tricky, though — philosophers call its study “&lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology/&quot;&gt;epistemology&lt;/a&gt;,” which roughly translates to “the reason of knowledge and understanding”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Any fool can know. The point is to understand”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;-&lt;/em&gt; Albert Einstein&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To know “the truth” you need not only good information, but all of the context required to create a full understanding. Without context, you are viewing only one piece to a larger puzzle. Most communication — especially short-form communication on the internet — is missing substantial context, which leads to misinterpretation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself two questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How often are your words on the internet fully understood and interpreted correctly by other people?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How often do you think, when you’re reading the news, you’re getting robust context?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more complex a topic — like hedge fund market dynamics — the more context is necessary to create a full understanding. Since civilization is advanced, the problems of the world are all quite complex, and people need to spend the extra care to gather context. With some topics, such as “building a growing economy”, the complexity is so staggeringly high that no single human can ever understand the entire problem. Literally &lt;em&gt;no one knows the full truth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you understand complexity and have “done your research”, when are you done? There are always “unknown unknowns” — context and perspectives out there that you didn’t even know you had to research in the first place. How unfair!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, “the full truth” is never fully attainable by anyone. Nevertheless, at some point we accept the reality we perceive, make judgements, and take action anyways. There’s no other option — we must try to seek our personal truth over time. As is said “the Truth will set you free,” so we must learn to wade through the complexity and our manage our personal biases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;example-box&quot;&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt; Recently GameStop has been in the news for it’s skyrocketing stock after a historic short squeeze, led by regular retail traders from Reddit, drove hedge funds to lose billions of dollars. Robinhood and other brokers limited $GME trading, and there was a massive backlash against the apps. The narrative? Robinhood was obeying orders from Billionaire Hedge Funds and the system was rigged. Both Ted Cruz and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1354830697459032066&quot;&gt;AOC&lt;/a&gt; seem to agree with that narrative.
Context that came out later:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Robinhood faced a liquidity crunch and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/robinhood-ceo-defends-gamestop-amc-nokia-trading-restrictions-2021-1&quot;&gt;proactively borrowed several hundred million dollars&lt;/a&gt;. They then limited trading so they could afford financial settlement with acceptable risk. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/robinhood-ceo-refutes-conspiracy-theory-hedge-funds-prompted-gamestop-trading-halt&quot;&gt;It wasn’t that they wanted to help Billionaires&lt;/a&gt;, but instead survive as a business.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Regular retail traders were the loud voices in the news, but other &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestop-frenzy-puts-spotlight-on-trading-giant-citadel-securities-11612089000&quot;&gt;hedge funds aligned with them to exploit the stock&lt;/a&gt;. This wasn’t as clean as “Wall Street vs Main Street,” as many wanted to believe.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;psychology-of-truth&quot;&gt;Psychology of Truth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all have our flaws. Unfortunately — you and I — we’re absolutely terrible at determining what is real from what isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of our psychological vulnerabilities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confirmation Bias&lt;/strong&gt;: Once we make judgements, we stick with them, and any information that appears to support our worldview will be welcomed instantly — even if it’s a stretch. Evidence to the contrary is ignored, and even causes us, on average, to irrationally &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/02/27/why-facts-dont-change-our-minds&quot;&gt;dig into their own beliefs&lt;/a&gt; instead of question them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-gain&lt;/strong&gt;: We look for information to help us increase our status. We share information we think others will like, because then they’ll like us.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entertainment&lt;/strong&gt;: The more sensationalist and crazy sounding the news, the more we are likely to engage with it, talk about it, and share it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fear&lt;/strong&gt;: If something makes us fearful, most people will first &lt;em&gt;assume it is true&lt;/em&gt; to hedge risk. After all, if it’s not true then there’s nothing to worry about!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of Time &amp;amp;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Laziness&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s a luxury to have time to do your own research. Even if you have the time, do you want to read a 5 sentence summary or a 10 page paper? Short content captures attention more easily, but leaves no room for nuance or context. This is best shown by the fact that we only read headlines — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/blue-sky/ct-share-this-link-without-reading-it-ap-bsi-20160618-story.html&quot;&gt;59% of all social media shares happen without reading the article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repetition Reinforcement:&lt;/strong&gt; if we hear something multiple times, we are more likely to believe it. This was the core propaganda technique of the Nazi party.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incorrect Focus&lt;/strong&gt;: Too much information about the wrong thing distracts us. If others talk about a single aspect of a topic, we naturally assume other aspects are less meaningful. This happens in science, for example, where the topics discussed are only those which are well funded.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hero Effect:&lt;/strong&gt; We are inclined to believe powerful people are out to get us. We actively want to be a protagonist against a planned, well-executing group of powerful, evil people. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/07/24/a-look-at-the-americans-who-believe-there-is-some-truth-to-the-conspiracy-theory-that-covid-19-was-planned/ft_20-07-15_conspiracies_new_01/&quot;&gt;40-50% of less educated Americans think COVID was intentionally planned by powerful people.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short Working Memory:&lt;/strong&gt; To hold nuanced views we have to be able to hold multiple topics in working, short-term memory. But when we are bombarded with hyper-active amounts of information, nothing stays in working memory long enough to create nuanced views.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s just to name a few! There are hundreds more, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases&quot;&gt;this list of 100+ cognitive biases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of us, what we believe is more predicated on our psychological vulnerabilities rather than what is true and real. This is why the scientific method was so revolutionary — it’s a framework for determining truth without requiring trust, faith, or belief in other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all suck at determining truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;group-dynamics-of-truth&quot;&gt;Group Dynamics of Truth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things get really chaotic once you move beyond the individual psychological level and into groups. From a very young age, we all seek to be accepted as part of an in-group — a community. It’s hard-wired into us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to collaborate with others, we modify our behavior and change our opinions to gain favor, and this pattern of &lt;a href=&quot;https://courses.lumenlearning.com/alamo-sociology/chapter/reading-conformity/&quot;&gt;conformity&lt;/a&gt; leads us into what sociologists call “&lt;a href=&quot;http://williamwolff.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/griffin-groupthink-challenger.pdf&quot;&gt;Groupthink&lt;/a&gt;” (Janis, 1972). Most people in their group will align with decisions based on whatever narrative is hot, no matter if it’s true or if anyone has decided to take the time to research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some symptoms of groupthink:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Thinking Delegation&lt;/strong&gt;: We listen to others and trust that they were able to do their own research. We offload our thinking to them so we don’t have to do it ourselves.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confidence Bias:&lt;/strong&gt; If someone is confident and appears to be speaking honestly, we often choose to believe them. Narcissists and sociopaths are able to convince people of false narratives because they believe in them themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inherent Morality&lt;/strong&gt;: If a group is part of our identity, we believe we are part of “the good guys”. No one wants to believe they are “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VImnpErdDzA&quot;&gt;the baddies&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-censorship&lt;/strong&gt;: We won’t say things if we don’t think our group will approve. We also censor negativity so as to avoid judgement of our personality.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Illusion of Unanimity&lt;/strong&gt;: Due to self-censorship, once a light decision is made it can falsely appear as though everyone agrees.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pressure on Dissenters&lt;/strong&gt;: If someone does dissent from the common judgement, others are incentivized to call them out and critique them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In small groups these symptoms help us work together with less drama — we have evolved them for a reason!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, as communities grow beyond our evolved norm (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number&quot;&gt;Dunbar’s Number&lt;/a&gt;), all of the symptoms become amplified and more dangerous. Why? The larger the community, the less people you know personally. Whereas telling an &lt;a href=&quot;https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-sociology/chapter/group-dynamics/&quot;&gt;intimate friend&lt;/a&gt; a hard truth might result in a stronger friendship, telling an acquaintance a hard truth usually results in abandonment. Jan Breitsohl, a lecturer out of the University of Glasglow, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/westburn/jcb/2015/00000014/00000002/art00002&quot;&gt;studied communities online in 2015&lt;/a&gt; and found Groupthink grows stronger at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“So, in the interests of survival, they trained themselves to be agreeing machines instead of thinking machines. All their minds had to do was to discover what other people were thinking, and then they thought that, too.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;-&lt;/em&gt; Kurt Vonnegut, Breakfast of Champions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, over time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Groups converge to have extremely similar beliefs. Individual, critical thinking vanishes into thin air.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Incentives grow stronger to follow the group even if it adapts and changes into something bad.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Larger groups are &lt;em&gt;more likely&lt;/em&gt; to be misinformed and &lt;em&gt;less likely&lt;/em&gt; to correct their mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;societal-truth&quot;&gt;Societal Truth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information spreads beyond just individuals and groups — it expands and adapts as it moves around our grand, interconnected social network of society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This happens via what anthropologists call a “meme”, and no, they’re not &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; funny internet pictures. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;id=hpU0FOqr2YEC&amp;amp;oi=fnd&amp;amp;pg=PP2&amp;amp;dq=meme&amp;amp;ots=guDC8SBFR9&amp;amp;sig=6owktrkgO2tO1yloaVp6okNCWcs#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=meme&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;Richard Dawkins&lt;/a&gt;, “a meme is information that spreads across culture in the form of ideas, behaviors and skills transferred from one person to another by imitation.” Today, we’re exchanging culture faster than ever before. Memes include fashion, inventions, mannerisms, jokes, and even stereotypes of other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of memes &amp;amp; their origins:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Washing your hands&lt;/strong&gt; to prevent the spread of germs &amp;amp; viruses. Now common, this started when a doctor named Ignaz Semmelweis made a singular discovery in a singular hospital that corpses carried germs in hospitals.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/21558524/conspiracy-theories-2020-qanon-covid-conspiracies-why&quot;&gt;QAnon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a now a large movement of conspiracy theorists who claim Donald Trump is taking down pedophile rings, and protecting the USA from corrupt Democrats. It started as a single post on a message board called 4chan, likely as a joke, until it gained serious traction &amp;amp; became powerful to its creator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our beliefs and world views are nothing more, really, than combinations of the memes we accept into our lives. We might change them a little and have unique thoughts, but by and large &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; beliefs you hold probably aren’t unique across a million people, let alone 8 billion people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a meme is out there in the wild, it is like a living, breathing thing — you don’t fully control it anymore! It wants nothing more to survive, and will adapt to ensure its survival. How does it live on? It plays a game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-game-of-belief&quot;&gt;The Game of Belief&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can imagine that ideas and behaviors, once communicated, are all playing a “game of belief”, in that they’re all vying for your attention and you get to pick the winner. When you choose to communicate memes to others, you are helping those memes win the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memes play this game not only through validity, but also by building teams and rapidly evolving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;meme-teams&quot;&gt;Meme Teams&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memes combine forces to help one another on their path for self-preservation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three types of memes on a team:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Central&lt;/strong&gt;: Memes that represent core beliefs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defense&lt;/strong&gt;: Memes that prevent you from leaving their Central Meme.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Offense&lt;/strong&gt;: Memes that spread their Central Meme.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/rebel-wisdom/the-war-on-sensemaking-53710561afce&quot;&gt;Daniel Schemblachter&lt;/a&gt; uses the example of Religion to explain these types of memes. In Christianity, “Belief in Christ as Savior” is a Central Meme. It is the core belief. Defense Memes could be “God demands faith and doubt is a sin” or “If you stop believing, you will lose your community”. If you ascribe to either of those memes, you’re less likely to ever abandon Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christianity’s offense Memes? Mission trips, “save the neighbors”, baptise your children, send kids to religious school, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Christianity, these patterns are present in every belief system that lasts. Whether it’s capitalism, communism, veganism, or sports fandom. Every world view has its beliefs, and people &lt;em&gt;naturally&lt;/em&gt; think of ways to defend and spread them. People fight for what they believe in. People create the offense and defense teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;memetic-evolution&quot;&gt;Memetic Evolution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As memes spread and are passed to various people, they are changed and edited. This happens both intentionally and accidentally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use Christianity as the example again, assess first Christ’s original beliefs. They centered around peace and unity. So how did Christianity somehow spawn violent crusades? Someone in power convinced others that crusades were the way to spread the teachings and take back holy land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When offense memes encounter defense memes from another belief system, you have competition between the two, and they will evolve to figure out who wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The game of belief intensifies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;narrative-war&quot;&gt;Narrative War&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All power structures have a foundation that is the belief in their validity. If enough people don’t believe in capitalism, it won’t work. If enough people don’t believe the church, it won’t be able to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All beginnings have an end — all power structures are inevitably replaced by something else — but most of them do not go quietly. Instead, some leaders of those power structures choose to go to war. They have a goal in mind, a worldview to spread, and their own power to defend. They also have influence and can make things happen in the world, which is why narrative warfare becomes so dangerous as it escalates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What really sets Narrative Warfare apart from the Game of Belief is that the general population — you and I — aren’t really players. We’re the ones being played.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our minds are the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of any power structure is to win the Narrative War by convincing people that you are on their side, believe what they believe, and will do what’s best for them. And instead of winning on merit, those fighting in Narrative War rely on outright manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It would not be impossible to prove with sufficient repetition and a psychological understanding of the people concerned that a square is in fact a circle. They are mere words, and words can be molded until they clothe ideas and disguise.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;-&lt;/em&gt; Joseph Goebbels, Nazi Reich Minister of Propaganda&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Narrative Warfare goes beyond just political parties and history, it is also conducted by modern nation states (including Russia, China, and the United States), their militaries, and intelligence agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Cognitive scientists, cultural anthropologists, behavior scientists, and game theory experts must be included as professional meme-wielding-gunfighters on future battlefields. The US must recognize the growing need for emerging disciplines in ideological warfare by ‘weaponeering’ memes.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;-&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20180219200439/http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a507172.pdf&quot;&gt;Major Michael Prosser the US Marine Corps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, Jeff Giesea — an alt-right organizer — penned an article “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stratcomcoe.org/jeff-giesea-its-time-embrace-memetic-warfare&quot;&gt;It’s Time to Embrace Memetic Warfare&lt;/a&gt;” in 2017 as a project of the NATO Strategic Communications Centre. Isn’t it telling that the same person “organizing the grassroots movement that helps elect Trump” is pitching the exact same tactics as useful for nation-to-nation combat? He even admits the risks, all while engaged in the corruption: “[my] biggest change of view, if I am being honest, is a nagging sense of dread. Memetic
warfare is only going to get more intense… free societies must be concerned about the corrosive effect these battles may have on our sense of trust in each other and our institutions”. Well, Jeff, thanks for calling out yourself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Own the narrative, via memes, and own the world. History has shown this is true, and so it is true today. Let’s cover some rules of Narrative War so we can better understand our present situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rule-1-start-by-co-opting-an-existing-movement&quot;&gt;Rule #1: Start by co-opting an existing movement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking throughout history, you can spot a trend: memetic evolution related to existing power structures. Those with power are able to co-opt existing movements, edit memes to their liking and distribute their “Shiny, Brand New!” version to their followers. This helps them gain and reinforce power very rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although QAnon was spawned by a random person on 4chan, it was later co-opted by people like Lin Wood, Rudy Giuliani, Jeff Giesea, and Donald Trump to help accelerate their fame and power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put simply, it’s a lot easier to convince people you’re on their side if you publicly pick their side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rule-2-make-people-less-unique&quot;&gt;Rule #2: Make people less unique&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have your foot in the door, you have to keep it going and convince more people. You have to make statements that people believe in. Unfortunately for you, many people have different beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you convince &lt;em&gt;millions&lt;/em&gt; of people that “you believe what they believe” if they’re all unique?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t. Instead, manipulate the narrative and divert people’s attention towards similar problems and similar beliefs. In effect, everyone becomes less unique — less of an individual. Once people have shifted their talking points to an topic you chose, align yourself with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional democratic republicanism is about representatives learning what their community believes and fighting for the people they represent — politicians adapting to constituents. Modern politics, via Narrative Warfare, is the exact opposite. It’s about manipulating people to believe things so they naturally end up on your side — constituents adapting to politicians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manipulating people like this sounds a bit evil, right? Well…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rule-3-power-games-attract-sociopaths&quot;&gt;Rule #3: Power games attract sociopaths&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many “zero sum” games in the world, and hierarchical games such as politics filter for people who are good at competing. Unfortunately for us, &lt;a href=&quot;https://leb.fbi.gov/articles/featured-articles/the-corporate-psychopath&quot;&gt;sociopaths outperform others at playing these games&lt;/a&gt;, and thus more of them end up as leaders of power structures engaging in Narrative War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rule-4-threatened-power-structures-escalate-manipulation&quot;&gt;Rule #4: Threatened power structures escalate manipulation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While all politicians lie, some of them will go much further than others. Truth is hard and some sociopaths feel the need to win no matter the cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If these people want to manipulate the narrative and convince people to believe in something, what is the easiest psychological vulnerability to prey upon? What is the fastest and most reliable way to build an audience?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Answer: Fear! Conspiracy! Evil people are out to get you!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what if it’s hard to make people fear another side? What if they’re not all that threatening?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Answer: Lie! Create alternative facts and alternative realities!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rule-5-lie--distort-reality-to-create-a-competitive-advantage&quot;&gt;Rule #5: Lie &amp;amp; distort reality to create a competitive advantage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is much easier to imagine and create fake realities than it is to accurately describe reality itself — in the time it takes to investigate facts and uncover truths, you could have made 10 alternate realities instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Narrative Warfare combatants employ many strategies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disinformation&lt;/strong&gt;: a direct lie, usually reserved for the most extreme of politicians and media outlets.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distortion&lt;/strong&gt;: lie via emphasis bias. Political “spin”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Omission&lt;/strong&gt;: lie by leaving out important counter-points. The most common type of lie on political media, where you only hear one side of the story.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bias alignment&lt;/strong&gt;: To maximize people’s attention and affinity, find out their pre-existing biases and align with them across the board. This works extremely well with “single issue voters”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Label generalization&lt;/strong&gt;: make generalizations about another group of people to make them seem like one set of people who are all the same. Very easy in a two-party political system.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make an enemy:&lt;/strong&gt; pitch the other side as the enemy, or against what you believe in. Do not let your followers believe the other side is interested in real debate. Be a victim.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conspiracy creation&lt;/strong&gt;: beyond harmless enemies, convince your followers the other side is filled with a powerful, secretive elite plotting their destruction. This triggers their psychological “hero effect” to believe you’re the protagonist and cultivates an environment where they’ll see all actions from the other side as misdirection (automatic creation of defense memes).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hero alignment&lt;/strong&gt;: brand yourself as the good guy. Take claim to irrefutably honorable qualities — you have no bias and are defending principles like “free speech” and “independent truth”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Over-simplification&lt;/strong&gt;: spoon feed information that is simple so people get it, even if there is missing context. Leave out things people might disagree with or might make them think critically. Over time this dumbs down the population.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complexity obfuscation:&lt;/strong&gt; make things sound more technically complex than they are, in hopes people view you as smart and off-load their critical thinking to you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viral focus:&lt;/strong&gt; Communicate ideas that make people click “like” and “share”. These are often lies or manipulated stories that prey upon our craving for sensationalism.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attention hijacking&lt;/strong&gt;: overwhelm your followers with fear against a specific group so it seems as though your group is under attack. Exploit people’s psychology that defaults to trust you when under attack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might see a pattern here. &lt;em&gt;Every single strategy used in Narrative Warfare preys upon a combination of our human, psychological vulnerabilities&lt;/em&gt;. This is why they’re super effective, and why so many fall to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rule-6-meme-reinforcement-creates-a-trap&quot;&gt;Rule #6: Meme reinforcement creates a trap&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Narrative Warfare media begins to distort people’s perceptions of reality and radicalize them, they pick a side and entrench themselves in the narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once that narrative is set, it is very difficult to change. As mentioned above, people will invent new defense memes in order to protect their own beliefs, even if the underpinnings of those ideas are faulty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the power structure’s narrative was predicated on, for example, making immigration sound like a threat to the nation, the party cannot effectively backpedal. If they try to change course, people will then claim those very individuals are against the original movement and purge them from the ranks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rule-7-power-structures-incentivize-credible-people-to-join&quot;&gt;Rule #7: Power structures incentivize credible people to join&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within any political party or organization that has been caught doing terrible things throughout history, there have always been “good people” who just happened to fall under the spell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They didn’t really believe it!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They didn’t think it would get that bad!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a democracy, when your voters are becoming radicalized and beholden to the Narrative War, you too must adapt or quit. Radicalize or lose the votes! Most politicians choose to keep their power, and thus join the side of the manipulators. In doing so, they make the entire process credible and far more dangerous. Instead of bad actors coming in and tricking all of us by overthrowing a working system, the system itself begins to decay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rule-8-the-narrative-war-is-bigger-than-the-players&quot;&gt;Rule #8: The Narrative War is bigger than the players&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so the decay continues on and on — the war is now out of any individual’s control. Those who set in into motion, perhaps fearful of their own creation, will find themselves far less powerful than before if they combat the narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“A man may die, nations may rise and fall, but an idea lives on.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;-&lt;/em&gt; John F Kennedy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social movements and people’s beliefs are resilient. Once set into motion, they evolve and, as per Rule #1, become co-opted by others who are perhaps even more nefarious. It could be another political leader who dreams of power or perhaps its a foreign nation-state seeking to sow chaos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;technological-acceleration&quot;&gt;Technological Acceleration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As our luck would have it, the internet &lt;em&gt;massively&lt;/em&gt; accelerates Narrative Warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I came to Silicon Valley in 2011, everyone was filled with hope and enthusiasm. Facebook was early in its mission to “connect everyone in the world” and few were very concerned about Google’s data collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sophocles said “Nothing vast enters the life of mortals without a curse.” As it turns out, if you succeed at connecting everyone in the world, people communicate in really strange ways. Often dangerous. And if you collect all of someone’s entire search history, the power you have over them is too immense for any individual to responsibly hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can attest — often engineers, product managers, and designers do not know what they are creating. While they believe they were on a personal mission to connect people across the globe, they likely do not realize the potentially evil tool they are giving sociopaths. I used to think the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 2008 to 2010 I built a political polling company with the hopes of connecting voters to their politicians instantly. Our goal? Encourage politicians to actually talk with their voters more, learn what their needs were, and enable listening at scale. Guess how it was used? Ask your voters questions, slice and dice your data, and then target them specifically so you can use them. Top GOP pollsters asked us if we could “collect data on families” and offered to buy us out. We refused because we didn’t want to be partisan, and within 2 weeks they had forced all of their politicians off of our platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, from 2011-2014, I built a community network with Lady Gaga that raised $20 million dollars and scaled to millions of users. Our goal? Bring communities together and create healthy relationships. With this in mind, we studied sociology to help communities form at a rapid pace and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Hooked-How-Build-Habit-Forming-Products/dp/1591847788&quot;&gt;psychology to “increase engagement”&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;em&gt;cough, make users addicted&lt;/em&gt;. Although we only reached a couple million people, Facebook now covers half of the global population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We cannot change the past, but today we must assess, realistically and honestly, what role technology has played in amplifying Narrative Warfare. It’s not pretty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;accelerant-1-misinformation-spreads-within-minutes-to-millions&quot;&gt;Accelerant #1: Misinformation spreads within minutes to millions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When sensationalist information is shared by political manipulators, it spreads fast. Outlets claiming to have no bias spread misleading narratives and outright false information on an hourly basis. Millions of people engage with it within minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;accelerant-2-groups-grow-large-very-fast-and-easily-remove-skeptics&quot;&gt;Accelerant #2: Groups grow large very fast and easily remove skeptics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can spin up a new blog website or Facebook Group and get 50,000 members within days if you have the right message. As we learned earlier, big groups are terrible at communicating reality and facilitating nuanced discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worse, on internet platforms skeptics can be purged in one-click — you don’t even have to debate them any more. Instead, censor first and… well, never ask questions either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;accelerant-3-algorithms-analyze-our-beliefs--let-politicians-target-us-via-advertising-networks&quot;&gt;Accelerant #3: Algorithms analyze our beliefs &amp;amp; let Politicians target us via advertising networks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every word, every click, and every second that passes as you look at a picture online is tracked, recorded and logged. This data from &lt;em&gt;billions&lt;/em&gt; of people is then fed into computers which categorize you across thousands of different variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If, for example, a politician wants to find people who might be afraid of immigration, they can target those who live in cities with changing demographics. Advertising networks, especially Facebook Ads, give politicians and organizations these super powers for pennies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;accelerant-4-targeting-automatically-exploits-psychological-weaknesses-with-ab-tests&quot;&gt;Accelerant #4: Targeting automatically exploits psychological weaknesses with “A/B tests”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you can target someone who might be afraid of immigration, how do you really know they’re afraid? How do you know if you’re effectively making them afraid, or just shouting into the wind with your advertisement?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook Ads and other advertising engines allow you to run multi-variable A/B tests. Imagine if you could easily make 100 different images and slogans, then test them within minutes to see which versions were getting the most clicks. That’s how Facebook’s systems work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And once someone clicked, you know who they are! You now know with 100% confidence they are your future follower — someone you will “re-target” over and over again, until they are your pawn in the Narrative War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This played out clearly in South Florida for the 2019 election. Turns out if you say “socialist plot” enough, &lt;a href=&quot;https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/01/12/miami-spanish-language-media-trump-conspiracies-cuban-communism/&quot;&gt;Cuban Americans in Florida really get scared and believe they’re fighting U.S. Communism&lt;/a&gt;. Odds are the Trump campaign never thought about targeting Cuban Americans in Florida, and instead Facebook &lt;em&gt;automatically&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;showed them&lt;/em&gt; that their message was working with those voters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;accelerant-5-the-internet-has-fragmented-the-media-and-demonetized-trustworthiness&quot;&gt;Accelerant #5: The internet has fragmented the media and demonetized trustworthiness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While people are subject to this manipulation, the foundation of trust is eroding around us. The internet has given people a lot of things to do besides read the news, so media outlets have become more sensational to drive more clicks. Fact-checking and editorial boards are no longer rewarded, so traditional outlets have destroyed their own credibility in their forced evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spinning up a new media blog now takes minutes and anyone can do it — all you need is an opinion. These new media blogs are, contrary to popular belief, even more willing to spread fake news and misinformation than traditional outlets. They have no serious reputation to protect and the money/engagement is of vital importance to their early growth. There is a lot of money in Narrative Warfare, so many decide to play the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-next&quot;&gt;What Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do we do about it? This is a historic moment where civilization is going to have to learn to adapt, else our suffering may dramatically increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have to get a lot wiser – there is no silver bullet. It’s a lot easier to identify the problem than recognize a solution, and most ideas fall into the bucket of “personal responsibility,” which is unreliable at scale. Still, I believe we must try, so here are some ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;moderate-yourself&quot;&gt;Moderate Yourself&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fully understand the foundations of Narrative Warfare, Memetics, and personal incentives.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stop trying to find simple answers and perspectives — let reality be complex. Be less confident and more intellectually vulnerable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Default to “no” on all conspiracy theories. There is no personal benefit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Avoid believing other groups are your enemy. Find conviction to make them potential collaborators.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ask “why” this group or person is sharing what they’re sharing, and not assuming they are being truthful.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be careful with what you share and understand its power to deceive.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Seriously consider alternative perspectives to your beliefs. Join more groups.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://constantrenewal.com/steel-man/&quot;&gt;Steelman your arguments&lt;/a&gt;. Discuss tradeoffs between beliefs and multiple solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apply the golden rule across your interactions with others. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;moderate-your-groups&quot;&gt;Moderate Your Groups&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First of all, do not encourage those who escalate the game — especially those who call for violence.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Demand accountability for those who have nefariously played these games.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Encourage alternative viewpoints and debate, even if you disagree with it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Encourage diverse communities where others aren’t censored easily.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Encourage critical thinking, balancing of tradeoffs, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Point out deceptive media but acknowledge the core reasons why someone shared it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;moderate-society&quot;&gt;Moderate Society&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Demand advertising network changes at Facebook and other social networks. Do not allow them to categorize or target us based on beliefs, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/business/help/164749007013531&quot;&gt;political look-alike audiences&lt;/a&gt;, or other exploitation vectors.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Encourage social networks to experiment with fact-checking tooling and misinformation management. If you need to extend faith, put it towards fact-checkers more than your own biases. If you distrust a specific fact-checker, try multiple.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spread the lessons of Narrative Warfare. Although I’m biased, think about sharing this post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any more ideas, I’m very interested in hearing them &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/zachtratar&quot;&gt;over Twitter&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To end on a more optimistic tone, I will state a core belief: we will evolve and learn. Humanity has always evolved to face its challenges, and this specific set of problems is so new it would be really remarkable if we already had the answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you take the assumption that we &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; get through this, we must come out the other end as a far wiser civilization. It requires us to solve core questions around humanity, and become smart about our own biases in the face of a complex search for truth. Just as the scientific revolution led to a world-changing 300 year spike in technological progress, perhaps a revolution stemming from Narrative Warfare will create a spike in cultural progress. I am hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;

                                <title>Declaration of a Global Ethic</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking a lot lately about the bitter division in US politics and how the internet is making everyone an extremist. I can’t help but think civilization, in many ways, has all been here before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When online, many people treat each other quite poorly – we label the “us” vs “them”, choose condemnation over collaboration, and mimc other’s negative behaviors into a collective death spiral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What could make people act nicer? What has historically done so?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our weakening institutions are of interest, especially institutionalized religion. I don’t believe people need religion to be good, but perhaps some people do need religion to default to good behavior. Perhaps the weekly jolt of indoctrination makes them habitually more likely to practice goodness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-golden-rule&quot;&gt;The Golden Rule&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What you wish upon others, you wish upon yourself.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;em&gt;hundreds&lt;/em&gt; of variations – in essentially every religion in the world, the “Golden Rule” pops up early in its history. Perhaps we’ve all been here before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps as the first tribes of people came into contact with others, their differences led them to amplify their division, create enemies, and promote destruction. And then, spread across the world in hundreds of different ways, maybe we learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is the Golden Rule a “counter-algorithm” to mitigate our tribal weaknesses?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;declaration-of-a-global-ethic&quot;&gt;Declaration of a Global Ethic&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While rabbit-holing around the rule’s origins, I came across the 1993 &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20130411195746/http://www.parliamentofreligions.org/_includes/FCKcontent/File/TowardsAGlobalEthic.pdf&quot;&gt;“Declaration of a Global Ethic”&lt;/a&gt; – a document espousing what we as individuals in society must do to heal and make progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a collaboration of 143 different religious leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a section I like in particular:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are interdependent. Each of us depends on the well-being of the whole, and so we have respect for the community of living beings, for people, animals, and plants, and for the preservation of Earth, the air, water and soil.
We take individual responsibility for all we do. All our decisions, actions, and failures to act have consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We must treat others as we wish others to treat us. We make a commitment to respect life and dignity, individuality and diversity, so that every person is treated humanely, without exception. We must have patience and acceptance. We must be able to forgive, learning form the past but never allowing ourselves to be enslaved by memories of hate. Opening our hearts to one another, we must sink our narrow differences for the cause of world community, practicing a culture of solidarity and relatedness.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We consider humankind a family. We must strive to be kind and generous. We must not live for ourselves alone, but should also serve others, never forgetting the children, the aged, the poor, the suffering, the disabled, the refugees and the lonely. No person should ever be considered or treated as a second-class citizen, or be exploited in any way whatsoever. There should be equal partnership between men and women. We must not commit any kind of sexual immorality. We must put behind us all forms of domination or abuse.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We commit ourselves to a culture of non-violence, respect, justice, and peace. We shall not oppress, injure, torture, or kill other human beings, forsaking violence as a means of settling differences.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We must strive for a just social and economic order, in which everyone has an equal chance to reach full potential as a human being. We must speak and act truthfully and with compassion, dealing fairly with all, and avoiding prejudice and hatred. We must not steal. We must move beyond the dominance of greed for power, prestige, money, and consumption to make a just and peaceful world.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Earth cannot be changed for the better unless the consciousness of individuals is changed first. We pledge to increase our awareness by disciplining our minds, by meditation, by prayer, or by positive thinking. Without risk and a readiness to sacrifice there can be no fundamental change in our situation. Therefore we commit ourselves to this global ethic, to understanding one another, and to socially beneficial, peace-fostering, and nature-friendly ways of life.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We invite all people, whether religious or not, to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we all followed the above principles, the world would look a heck of a lot different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someday we’ll get there.&lt;/p&gt;

                                <title>Voter Fraud? GOP Claim Quick Debunk</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in 2009 I founded by first startup, a political polling via text message company, while a freshman in college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We eventually gained some steam and were able to get an introduction to this asshole named &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jmclghln?lang=en&quot;&gt;John McLaughlin&lt;/a&gt;, one of the Republican Party’s “top pollsters”. He offered to buy out our company for the GOP (which we refused). As a silly freshman does in 2009, I decided to add him on Facebook back then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to today and he’s literally Donald Trump’s go-to pollster. I’m one degree from him, and have seen him change over the last 10 years from “polling to get data” to “polling as propaganda.” The propaganda that comes out of his facebook is usually laughable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now it has become sinister.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays we have the entire GOP political apparatus claiming there was widespread voter fraud, shaking the faith Americans have in democracy itself. After Trump’s loss in the election and his subsequent claims of fraud, Republican’s belief in US elections has dropped to under 15%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is that? They’re all over Facebook. They’re eating up the trash that John McLaughlin and his GOP cronies serve up on a daily basis. When I log in to Facebook, guess what I see?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;full&quot; src=&quot;/img/posts/2020-11-10-voter-fraud/1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On his twitter, the post has 45 retweets alone. It’s spreading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;18-million-ghost-voters-sounds-scary&quot;&gt;1.8 million ghost voters! Sounds scary!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a big number, and of course, as an American, I am genuinely desiring of a legitimate election. So despite Trump losing every single voter fraud court case thus far, I wanted to check in on this 1.8 million ghost voter story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story is from “The Washington Times,” which is pulling the Judicial Watch “study”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;full&quot; src=&quot;/img/posts/2020-11-10-voter-fraud/2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you then click into the study, you got to the Judicial Watch’s press release. Yet another link then brings you to the study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here it is. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.judicialwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Judicial-Watch-Voter-Roll-Study-Oct-2020-1.pdf&quot;&gt;You can see the study in its entirety&lt;/a&gt;. It’s literally just a spreadsheet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;full&quot; src=&quot;/img/posts/2020-11-10-voter-fraud/3.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;County by county, Judicial Watch shows where the voter registrations are higher than the number of potential voters. Eek! And that thus there were “ghost voters” — voters who don’t exist. Fraudulent ballots.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They then add up all these overages to get a total number of &lt;em&gt;1.8 million v&lt;/em&gt;oters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the entire analysis is comically fragile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;weakness-1-cvap-already-has-quite-a-lot-of-error&quot;&gt;Weakness #1: CVAP already has quite a lot of error.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CVAP (Census Voting Age Population) estimate for 2018 is based on the old census’ population estimate of the area, and then projects how may people in that population &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be voting eligible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The estimate is controversial because i&lt;a href=&quot;https://campaignlegal.org/update/census-bureaus-citizenship-data-collection-misguided-and-harmful&quot;&gt;t’s often inaccurate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservatively, the CVAP already has a +-5% error rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;weakness-2-populations-in-decline--voters-who-havent-changed-their-locations&quot;&gt;Weakness #2: Populations in decline → voters who haven’t changed their locations.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the top 3 counties (Lowdes, Macon, Wilcox), let’s dig in further. Here are their populations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;full&quot; src=&quot;/img/posts/2020-11-10-voter-fraud/4.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;full&quot; src=&quot;/img/posts/2020-11-10-voter-fraud/5.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;full&quot; src=&quot;/img/posts/2020-11-10-voter-fraud/6.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notice anything?&lt;/em&gt; They are all going through population declines at roughly 5.2% per 5 years!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When people move away, they can stay registered to vote in an old location, thus further inflating the ratio’s error.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This alone can add another ~5% of error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you may think — but Lowdes is at 129%! Even with 10% what about the other 19% who voted?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is where it all just goes from weak calculations to intentional propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;weakness-3-the-entire-study-says-nothing-about-voting-in-fact-the-math-works-out&quot;&gt;Weakness #3: The entire study says &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; about voting. In fact, the math works out!**&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study measures registered voters over an estimate of total potential voters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It says nothing about the actual votes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we actually wanted to find evidence of ghost voters, we’d want to see that the # of votes was higher than the overall voting population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Lowndes you have a voting population estimate of 7,890, given the CVAP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many votes were there in Lowndes? Let’s look at Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;full&quot; src=&quot;/img/posts/2020-11-10-voter-fraud/7.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were 6,830 votes, giving an estimated voter turnout of 86%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, that does sound high! But it isn’t over 100%, and all of the sudden the entire claim of “ghost voters” falls apart. The evidence just isn’t there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;want-to-know-the-best-part&quot;&gt;Want to know the best part?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s look how these counties break down racially, using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sos.alabama.gov/alabama-votes/voter/election-data&quot;&gt;Alabama’s own census data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lowndes is 74% Black.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Macon is 83% Black.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilcox is 70% Black.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened this year? Black voters came out and made their voice heard.&lt;/strong&gt; And the GOP just can’t believe that — after all, Trump is “the best President for Blacks in the history of the United States”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So instead what does the GOP do? They lie. They mislead. They spread propaganda, and power-hungry assholes like John McLaughlin do their bidding. They don’t even care to do the research anymore when a “top pollster” decides to share a single spreadsheet with weak analysis and the most politicized, anti-American message possible: mass voter fraud — “illegal votes” — without real evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Americans, this should concern all of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radicalized Trump supporters believe these things without doing research, because it appears as though a “Real News Source” like the Washington Times, with “Judicial Watch” did the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is “The Washington Times”? Although you can’t tell on the website, it’s a conservative “news outlet” founded by Sun Myung Moon, who claimed to be a messiah. Seriously.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is Judicial Watch? Turns out it’s a conservative activist group, known for strategically promoting conspiracy theories. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_Watch&quot;&gt;Take a look yourself.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must be vigilant in the days ahead as propaganda spreads like wildfire across Facebook. We need a peaceful transition power now more than ever, and it’s up to us (unfortunately) to call out the propaganda in the social sphere as the courts halt it in the judiciary.&lt;/p&gt;

                                <title>Introducing BillionaireBoard</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you ever think about what you’d do with a billion dollars?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not talking about what you’d choose to buy. Instead, which of the world’s problems would you try to solve? You could start entire companies, hire people, conduct mass-scale research, and maybe — just maybe — even influence Governments 🤯.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty fun to think about, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bill Gates over the last couple decades has focused on the eradication of malaria, low cost toilets, safe nuclear power, and more. After seeing some of the media around these innovations a while back, I became curious: what are all the other billionaires up to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hours and hours of boring research commenced — tax forms, foundation websites, news articles, and even lawsuits. Although major donations were happening every week, building my personal research spreadsheet became an absolute nightmare… and I was still on my 2nd billionaire!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are ~2,200 billionaires in the world, by the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My plan for research had totally failed, but my questions still felt important:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Who is donating &amp;amp; impact investing into what? How much?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are they giving a lot? What about compared to their lifetime giving, or their net worth?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are these projects, exactly? Are they going well, and is the money being spent well?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-can-the-public-help&quot;&gt;How can the public help?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was thinking about these questions, some tweets rolled into my feed — Mark Zuckerberg had just donated a couple hundred million dollars to medical research. What did people do? They mostly took the opportunity to yell at him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many people understandably default to anger in our age of mass inequality, it’s also true that Mark has a lifetime goal to “cure all diseases” and &lt;a href=&quot;https://billionaireboard.com/billionaires/mark-zuckerberg&quot;&gt;has pledged to donate 99% of his wealth&lt;/a&gt; to take on the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Billionaires don’t always have all the answers themselves. They contract with research institutes, think tanks, and other institutions to help them answer their fundamental question: “How do I spend this money effectively?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016, Jeff Bezos famously &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeffbezos/status/875418348598603776?lang=en&quot;&gt;posted a “request for ideas”&lt;/a&gt; on twitter. Thousands of ideas were submitted and afterwards Jeff dramatically increased his rate of giving. Through an open competition, the public also helped Bill Gates &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-foundation-helps-invent-tiger-toilets-powered-by-worms-2019-1&quot;&gt;discover a $350 toilet design&lt;/a&gt; for developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the public can help foundations identify more opportunities?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;launching-billionaireboard-with-covid-19&quot;&gt;Launching BillionaireBoard with COVID-19&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the help of 15 researchers, &lt;a href=&quot;https://billionaireboard.com&quot;&gt;BillionaireBoard&lt;/a&gt; launches today as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The first open dataset on billionaires’ donations &amp;amp; impact investments.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A monthly leaderboard to see who has been contributing the most recently.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An interactive movement where we, the public, can attempt to improve philanthropy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://billionaireboard.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;full&quot; src=&quot;/img/posts/billionaireboard.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it all starts with a focus on &lt;a href=&quot;https://billionaireboard.com/causes/covid-19&quot;&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the first pieces of the site were coming together, the coronavirus began to spread across the globe. While Governments proved too slow to solve the problem ahead of time, the first reports of Billionaires buying masks for hospitals came out. Then, as federal relief responses were stuck in Congress, some Billionaires began funding ventilator manufacturing and vaccine development. Lastly, as of today, it’s incredible to say that the world’s Billionaires have funded as much COVID-19 scientific research &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/coronavirus/where-is-your-money-going-investigative-unit-tracks-federal-covid-19-spending/2274950/&quot;&gt;as the federal grant system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that Billionaires are “the solution” — just that they are already a major part of it, and clearly want to help. I believe that’s worth embracing and amplifying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus far, BillionaireBoard researchers have tracked that 17 billionaires have given or pledged about ~$1.88 billion dollars around the world to mitigate the pandemic, provide PPE to front-line health workers, and work on disease research. We’re still in the early days and expect more giving as the pandemic evolves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://billionaireboard.com&quot;&gt;https://billionaireboard.com&lt;/a&gt; and join today! You can click on each billionaire, learn about their focus areas, and encourage them to provide more funding. Each month the theme of the website will change so we, together, can encourage more types of philanthropy and investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-experiment&quot;&gt;An experiment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll say it now: my background isn’t in philanthropy, and I know achieving results is far more complex than putting a bit of data on a website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BillionaireBoard is an experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can we gather all of the data for all 2,200 billionaires?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can we actually accelerate philanthropy through transparency &amp;amp; helping identify new projects?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can we engage with billionaires and their foundations in a useful way?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope so. All we know so far is that Billionaires can make a difference with their wealth. They can help save lives, create innovation, and muster resources. They can convince local Governments to prevent outbreaks and jumpstart scientific advancement. Their immense power comes with great responsibility, and I hope we can all help them use it well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;join-billionaireboard&quot;&gt;Join BillionaireBoard&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need help with more important research! Today, BillionaireBoard partially covers ~30 billionaires, so there’s a lot of remaining ground to cover. Anyone can be a researcher by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/groups/billionaireboard&quot;&gt;joining our Facebook Group&lt;/a&gt; and contributing sourced data via “propose edit” buttons on Billionaire’s profiles. All data is verified for accuracy before being posted onto the live website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a software developer, we have an API for submitting data, and if you work for a billionaire or at a foundation, we’d be happy to give you access to ensure the accuracy of your data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Send me a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/zachtratar&quot;&gt;tweet or personal message&lt;/a&gt; to get in touch.&lt;/p&gt;

                                <title>Balancing Organizations &amp; Oneself</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was at a tech event in San Francisco recently, a CEO was asked how they thought about balancing new initiatives with the core business, and their answer was simple but broadly applicable to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It struck me as particularly the type of advice one can only learn from experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;balancing-an-organization&quot;&gt;Balancing an organization&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All teams across an organization need resources. Most teams don’t have enough people for the goals they set out to achieve, and without these resources, some projects will fail. If your success has stemmed from a unique strategy that continues to win, how can you justify peeling useful resources away from it, and dooming it to a larger probability of failure in the name of new, unvalidated initiatives?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can imagine there are a bunch of “good” answers: analyzing opportunity-cost, finding new markets with higher growth rates, cultivating higher margin revenue streams, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the reality was more simple than analytical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the organization is doing too many things. When this is true, the product will often stagnate, sales people will report more losing deals, and teams will slow down. You will start to lose too many battles. This is obvious when it is starting to happen, and most in the organization — especially leadership — will have the strong, innate urge to focus resources. People don’t like to lose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, sometimes the organization isn’t doing enough things, and the larger, cash-cow teams will grow and grow until you see folks working on things that clearly aren’t critical — they will become the metaphorical “cog in the machine,” spinning because they’re supposed to, but going nowhere. In this scenario, especially in the technology industry, innovators in the company — especially leadership — will have the strong, innate urge to launch more impactful projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no necessary deeper analysis. Instead, the organization — while it’s growing — is naturally bouncing back and forth between two &lt;em&gt;feelings&lt;/em&gt;. And these feelings tend to be obvious, as long as people are honest with themselves and their teammates. Thus, striking a balance is about being aware of your feelings and the feelings of those around you. [0]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if no one feels strongly either way, then you’re probably sufficiently balanced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;balancing-yourself&quot;&gt;Balancing yourself&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I’ve been thinking about this idea for a while, I think this approach is applicable to self-management as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we stumble around our life journeys, we often fail over and over again. Eventually, once we find something we’re kinda good at, we cling to it and it becomes a part of our routine &amp;amp; identity. Although continuous practice is a key to success, people often go overboard: they stick to what they find comfortable and close themselves off from new, potentially risky experiences. Discovering new skills, friendships, and responsibilities requires us to sacrifice our successful routines and identities in the face of likely discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how can we think about balancing our existing “successful” routines with new experiences?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common analytical approach in life coaching is to leverage the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wheeloflife.noomii.com/&quot;&gt;“Wheel of Life”&lt;/a&gt;. With it, you rank your life in several various categories, and then create action plans to try new things in the areas you are weak. This works to an extent, but the method has many gaps [1]. Answering the question “should I try more things?” might be easier with an emotional approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people are trying too many things, they bounce around frantically, lose focus, and rarely make progress on bigger tasks/goals. So ask yourself: How do you feel about your progress as of late, and is that progress meaningful to your desired identity?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, when people don’t try enough new things, their chances of finding their innate passions, talents, and interests plummet. So ask yourself: How passionate do you feel, and how much have you discovered about yourself lately?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no necessary deeper analysis; you just have to be aware of your feelings. If you aren’t passionate (with or without progress), expose yourself to new experiences. If you are passionate, but feel as though you’re not making good progress, try fewer things and focus on that which is most important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re both passionate and making progress, congratulations, you’ve probably found your balance!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Footnotes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[0] This has cultural implications. It’s a lot easier to balance an honest organization than one where people either ignore problems, or perceive everything as urgent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1] The Wheel of Life doesn’t account for identity, talents, or interests. The metrics only exist to force you to judge yourself relativistically.&lt;/p&gt;

                                <title>Training Motivation with a Slow Computer</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple years ago, I was reflecting on my life and realized something weird: for the first time in my life, I was unusually… &lt;em&gt;organized&lt;/em&gt;. And not just with my physical world, but with my thoughts, plans &amp;amp; actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-sudden-change&quot;&gt;A Sudden Change&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This felt strange. I was never a particularly organized person. I never made my bed, left things out on kitchen counters, forgot dishes in the sink &lt;em&gt;(the most evil action of them all)&lt;/em&gt;, and let the mail pile up. Heck, if someone wants to contact me, that’s what email is for, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this chaos was normal for me, and when I thought of who I was, I had kind of accepted this lifestyle. It didn’t seem all that bad. I was doing ok. People care about this stuff too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So fast forward to my moment of reflection, and all of the sudden everything was… mind-blowingly different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was different.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no eureka moment, no being “fed up” with the mess, and no spur of insight. I honestly couldn’t explain what had changed or why it had changed, but I was definitely thinking differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of letting messes accumulate, I was defaulting to organization. I simply had the energy to do it, and I would do it. When I had a thought, I’d write it down and internalize it. Wonderfully, I felt like I was starting to truly understand myself as I would write things down, and that feeling created a feedback loop leading to more thoughts, more understanding, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recording my thoughts habitually into Evernote&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Journaling every now and then&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maintaining a to-do list, and crushing it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Working in sprints (3 hours on, 30 mins off)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Planning every month, week, and day down to the detail&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And more…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never had a theory of why I changed, or how, until now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;was-i-accidentally-training-my-attention--willpower&quot;&gt;Was I accidentally training my attention &amp;amp; willpower?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After being recommended the book for the 10th time, I gave in and started to read “Thinking Fast and Slow” by Dan Kahneman. In the book, Dan starts by highlighting numerous psychological studies &amp;amp; their often surprising results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these studies were later proven false, but to the best of my research the one I’m about to mention has retained validity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Dan &amp;amp; the team of researchers, attention and self-discipline are linked. Some people are naturally better at controlling their attention, and those people rank higher on many aptitude tests including those measuring intelligence. The most jarring thing though, for me, was that they all also tend to exhibit much higher rates of organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In subsequent tests, people were told to play video games that required them to continuously build upon their attention &amp;amp; self-discipline. Have you ever played Mario, and because you’re going for all-out speed, you make a silly mistake? Yeah, that’s the opposite of self-discipline in this scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people who played the game were able to increase their ability to stay focused throughout, and then those improvements &lt;em&gt;actually transferred over to other tasks&lt;/em&gt;. Those who played the games, and trained their attention, were able to perform better on the same aptitute tests they took prior to playing the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So where does this bring me? Was I playing a ton of games, or something? No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I was — to an extremely stupid degree — training my attention on accident. Like a game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;productivity-starts-with-a-slow-computer&quot;&gt;Productivity starts with a slow computer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my quest to build a startup company with very little money in the bank, I decided I couldn’t afford a shiny, new computer. I had a 2010 Macbook Air, which sounds fine, but the damn thing’s battery was so bad it had to be plugged in at all times. Worse, the CPU would constantly clock down thinking it was going to run out of battery, and everything would move at about ~20% speed every other minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, these were some of the most productive days I ever had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I would sit their coding or designing, the actual movements on the screen, such as my cursor, would lag for seconds. I would sit there and wait, see the result, take another action, and then wait again. It was absurd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I’d show my friends some piece of code, and they’d see the computer running as god-awfully slow as it was, they would freak out at me and be amazed I was getting anything done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But again, these were probably the most productive days of my entire life!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I sat there waiting — praying — for the computer to do it’s job and compute things for me, I’d never hit alt+tab to check Facebook. I literally couldn’t: alt-tabbing would have made it take 30 seconds longer. While my app was compiling and logs were streaming, I’d just sit there staring at the little black box produce text. I remember it feeling very meditative. I didn’t feel the need to multi-task because I simply couldn’t. When the app had finished compiling, I’d quietly – albeit slowly – get back in the productivity game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What’s Next&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, my computer runs fast. When my apps are building, you can bet I’m awkwardly attempting to multi-task &amp;amp; open up a new tab in chrome. My habit of appreciating the slow has faded, and honestly, so has much of the feeling of internal organization. I’m genuinely worse at writing down my thoughts habitually, expounding them in detail, and feeling like I know myself (in general). I clean my apartment regularly-&lt;em&gt;ish&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I’m going to use this potential new insight to try and go slower again, and just see what that does. As stupid as it sounds, this is going to be way more difficult this time around… since my computer is fast.&lt;/p&gt;

                                <title>Maxims &amp;amp; Inspiration</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;Even though Spock fans would disagree, we’re all guided by our emotions. When they arise through passion, we can channel them to produce and create wonderous things. When our emotions dull or lower, we have a natural inclination to dwell and despair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I began thinking about this, I grew curious. Could a routine help reinforce productive emotions and truly mitigate – not just ignore – the reverse?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that emotions have two primary sources: preceding emotions and logical deductions. If we believe ourselves to be in a position of greatness, it is easy to get excited and attempt to manifest such a position. If one tells us we are incapable of something or that our ideas have no merit, we question our own capability and reinforce that belief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;External happenstances that guide our emotions are unavoidable. Some may consider that to be a bit scary, but we all have a powerful tool to fight the good fight: internal dialogue! With our own thought, we all occasionally have epiphanies – small and large – that makes us &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; good. And we should feel good; we just figured something out! Go team!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But where do these epiphanies come from and once we have them and how often do they really stick with us? I found that I rarely kept track of mine and, as a result, kept asking myself the same questions over and over again. These epiphanies are logical in nature and wildly differ from person to person, but they certainly affect emotions. Since logic can be re-stated time and time again, perhaps we can use it to our advantage and guide ourselves towards a consistently healthy state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;its-called-a-maxim&quot;&gt;It’s called a Maxim!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve probably heard either the terms “Maxim” or “Proverb” before. They mean the same thing: a short statement of truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated.” - Confucious&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Very little is is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself, in your way of thinking.” - Marcus Aurelius&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“You have power over your mind — not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.” - Marcus Aurelius&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius, Emperor of Rome, is considered to be one of the wisest men to have ever lived, but even he realized his own weaknesses. So what did he do? He set up a daily routine to battle them. Upon waking, Marcus would recite his own personalized maxims and ponder their meaning; these were quick refreshers that helped guide the rest of his day, week, month, and year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;modern-society-and-me&quot;&gt;Modern Society and Me&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that modern society prioritizes sources of inspiration in a completely backwards manner: ease-of-discovery dominates efficacy. People hang inspirational posters, collect items on Pinterest, and even go searching for the oh-so-loved “like” on social networks. We look for small glimmers of social proof and meaning through luck — we think “perhaps the outside world holds the same things to be true as my inner self!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much time does that leave for us to focus and reflect upon our own thoughts? Not enough, in my opinion, and oh what a shame! We understand ourselves better than anyone else, which means we &lt;em&gt;resonate with our own, personal discoveries the most!&lt;/em&gt; What would it mean to you if you had an essentially unlimited, effective source of inspiration? We can create sources of daily inspiration that are targeted towards our most foundational of needs, optimized for our current state of life, and — most importantly — &lt;em&gt;guide us specifically towards who we want to be&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although cute, no kitten on a tree that says “hang in there” is going to prove comparable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did a little experiment and pushed myself to create a couple maxims every week. As I set aside 15 minutes every morning to go over my own list and think in peace, I found the benefits to be immediete and immense. Just like starting the day with a win by making my bed, I’ve found that I feel more able and positive when I calibrate my thoughts. It makes small problems stay small — or at least &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; small — and become more manageable. Oh, and it makes even the smallest of wins fit into a larger framework, which means their value isn’t simply forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it helped me, I thought I’d share with everyone who might be interested and end up reading this. Here are a couple things I’ve learned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It takes repetition. If not every day, every other day seems to be nearly as effective (but there’s definitely a difference).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You’ll eventually have a large list of maxims if you keep at it. As you keep creating, also focus on condensing any overlapping points. It needs to remains clear and concise… which brings me to the next point.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creating your own maxims helps you understand a little bit more about yourself. Answering “Who am I?” becomes quite a bit easier, and the result more vivid.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Targeting your current emotional state when reflecting is really effective. Just lose a battle? Focus on the war.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a proponent of Science, I also want to note that none of this was scientific in the slightest. Shoot me a tweet if you’re thinking about trying this out; I’d love to hear about your discoveries!&lt;/p&gt;

                                <title>Followr V1: New Features and Insights</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;http://zachtratar.com/followr.html&quot;&gt;wrote about&lt;/a&gt; and launched Followr two weeks ago, a chrome extension designed to help people gain traction on twitter through automated means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was truly surprised by people’s reactions. I expected to be crushed by the community, but nearly everyone was kind and positive.  Oh – there was one person who called me mentally delusional. &lt;em&gt;Thanks, stranger!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I received so much great feedback that I decided to act quickly. Today, I’m releasing Followr v1.0.0, the 2nd public release. You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://ztratar.github.io/followr&quot;&gt;download it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-features-in-v1&quot;&gt;New Features In V1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History &amp;amp; Conversion Tracking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now see what actions Followr is taking in the “History” page. When favorites convert into followers, the specific tweet is marked as “Converted!” You can also see your total gained followers from Followr on the “Setup” page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Granular Control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most requested features was a blacklist, and so it came to be. Followr will never favorite tweets that contain words in the blacklist. Multi-word search queries were also returning poorly relevant results, so Followr now searches for exact query strings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved Interface &amp;amp; Tutorial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous interface was missing a lot of highly relevant information. The new tutorial guides and informs new users. The extension popout now shows you which account Followr is using. I rebuilt the entire interface front the ground up, so pictures will do more justice than words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;full&quot; src=&quot;/img/posts/followrV1/setup-tab.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;full&quot; src=&quot;/img/posts/followrV1/history-tab.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;full&quot; src=&quot;/img/posts/followrV1/progress.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stealth / Anti-Detection Improvements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opening up Followr would previously append a ?followr=true variable to the window — lame. Followr now uses script injection to control Twitter’s native frontend controls. The time interval that dictates when Followr runs has also been randomized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-whats-next&quot;&gt;So, what’s next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is still much work to be done and Followr is open-source, so let me know if you want to help out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Query Effectiveness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I’m satisfied with the interface and basic favoriting mechanisms, I want to make fewer actions convert into more followers. To do this, the search queries will be optimized using previous data. I would probably be able to do a better job on this if I centralized some data, but I’m not sure that’s a good choice. Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code Cleanup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I admittedly fell into callback hell. The code could use a good ol’ refactoring to become squeaky clean. I’m thinking about implementing the next version using Promises, which would be quite fun. The CSS is also getting quite gross — I’ll switch over to LESS &amp;amp; Grunt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-lovely-reviews&quot;&gt;Some lovely reviews&lt;/h2&gt;

                                <title>Popcorn Time And Tech's Duty To Do The Right Thing</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When I first started writing this post, I didn’t know where it would end up. This post covers many topics — maybe too many — so I want to emphasize one thing right now: the last section means the most to me. If you’re only going to read for 15-20 seconds, please skip to the last section. Thanks, Zach.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-apathy&quot;&gt;My Apathy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I vividly remember the first time I used Napster. I was 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My cousin and I were playing video games when his older sister began to play a new Blink-182 song on her computer. I ran over to check it out and saw a blue download bar moving at speeds I had never seen - turns out my Uncle had just bought a T1 internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My cousin and I stayed up all night downloading music illegally. We didn’t know any better. We had only a faint idea of copyright law and this program, so readily accessible, surely didn’t &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; bad. Bad things are hard to do, &lt;em&gt;right?&lt;/em&gt; Plus, this was fun! Bad things can’t be fun, &lt;em&gt;right?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I stopped downloading and torrenting files years ago, I was never truly disturbed by pirating. I didn’t like the idea of taking someones work for free, but my disdain wasn’t at a level where I felt like I wanted to say anything, let alone take action. When I watched Governments destroy the lives of The Pirate Bay creators, I vilified the Governments. If my friend loaded up a torrent to stream on a projector, I wouldn’t think twice… I’d just go in the kitchen and make some popcorn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;popcorn-time&quot;&gt;Popcorn Time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was shown Popcorn Time a couple weeks ago and my mind was subsequently blown. Popcorn Time was beautiful — it was the first beautiful pirating application I had ever seen. I could search for nearly any movie and have it playing in a matter of seconds with two clicks. This was something my Mom could use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time, in that brief moment of realization, I felt scared — even sorry — for the media industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As they say, with great power comes great responsibility. Popcorn Time is too good at what it does. I know where to draw the line for my own uses of technology, but most ten year olds, for example, aren’t going to give a shit. Nothing easy and fun can be that bad, &lt;em&gt;right?&lt;/em&gt; They’re going to download and download until one day, their parents finally ask “Hey, what is that?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, you know, “it’s just this app where I can get any movie for free!” Many parents won’t know any better. The kids will install it for them, skip the fear-provoking warning screen, and move the entire, blissfully ignorant family into torrenting territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This territory has been historically small due to the illicit nature of piracy and its accompanying environment. Back in the early 2000s, Napster, Limewire, and Kazaa were distribution machines for not only music, but also computer viruses. If people didn’t weren’t technically savvy, they were likely to download something stupid and brick their computer. Many people chose to not run the risk. The suspect conditions surrounding piracy still live today; most torrenting sites are plastered with porn ads and get-rich-quick schemes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with all of these things preventing piracy, over half of all Americans have admitted to partaking. Half — that’s a lot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.dailytech.com/nimage/Piracy_Percentages_Wide.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remove the unpleasing experience from piracy and what can happen? Popcorn Time will not be the last application open this door. It has proven that you can layer a great, seemingly clean experience on top of an illicit foundation. They’ve shown that doing so can result in a flock of people wanting more — after all, everyone needs to save money in these tough times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know how many people would use something like Popcorn Time, but I think the number could be extraordinarily high — so high that it may not only do significant damage, but also shake the media industry into a partial collapse. I don’t want that to happen. The media industry creates beautiful pieces of artwork that help inspire and define generations. It enables dreams and floods people with shared imaginations in a sometimes otherwise dark world. It’s an important asset for this nation and the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-media-industry&quot;&gt;The Media Industry&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The media industry knows they need to adapt to continue making money, but how should they adapt? It’s a difficult question to answer, so let’s get some perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire music industry, for example, is not massive — overall revenue last year was only $16.5 billion. WhatsApp, a single company, sold for $19 billion to Facebook last month. The kingpins of media are attempting to protect their revenue streams to the best of their abilities and they see piracy as their primary enemy. With limited capital, the best means of exerting power is through… you guessed it, Government!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for them (and us), they don’t collectively understand technology. Every attempt they make to fix copyright protection results in proposed legislation that tramples internet freedom. I think there are many people in tech who would be on their side if real compromise was put on the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As ineffective as the media industry may be at proposing such compromise, I’m also seeing apathy from tech industry leadership. We constantly put the ball in the media industry’s court to create legislation before we say “No! That sucks too!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So again, &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; should they adapt?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may be controversial, but I don’t think they possess the abilities to cleanly save themselves. If they’re on their own, I believe there will be collateral damage. Internet freedom will continually be in the crosshairs, albeit unnecessary, if the media industry doesn’t get help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the goals for the media industry are pretty clear, so why doesn’t the tech industry give it a shot?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legislation that hits a good middle ground is possible if and only if the right people are working on it. I think the leaders of the tech industry need to to go the extra mile, work with Hollywood, and spearhead their own version of fresh, internet-preserving copyright protection law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;doing-the-right-thing&quot;&gt;Doing The Right Thing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just ranted about the media industry — can these same concepts be generalized? Should they be? Let’s think philosophically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology possesses great power — the likes of which are being scrutinized by the world. Who are these techies on buses? Why can’t I afford rent anymore? Why are robots replacing hard-working people in factories?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As technology moves forward, it is inevitable that it will grow in both good and bad ways. “Software is eating the world” — think about that sentence for the second. To engineers it is a rallying cry for beautiful efficiency, to others it sounds flat out horrifying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re all human. Transition is extremely hard — it is emotionally draining upon individuals and society. For technology to make the most optimal impact, it must be smooth and welcomed, its benefits clear as day and its intentions unquestionably pure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People should be uniting around Science and Technology, not against it. Technology must be viewed as something magical instead of malicious. It is so easy for technology, computing especially, to seem cold, self-interested, and reckless; making it friendly, warm, and benevolent will take effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology has enabled piracy to flip the media industry upside down and that is just the beginning. Very soon, technology will start having more pronounced effects on labor and manufacturing through 3D printing and the internet of things. We won’t be talking about piracy and media then, we’ll be talking about millions of jobs and economic conditions never studied in recorded history. As a whole, our quest for innovation must be balanced with careful wisdom and — I’ll say it — an appreciation for the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We cannot enact change that affects billions of lives and then say “fend for yourself, figure out the new rules”. I believe we must hold out our hands, share   a vision for what is newly possible, and, most importantly, show people what role they can play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is in our ability — &lt;em&gt;no ones else’s&lt;/em&gt;, and thus I believe it is our duty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to my friends for feedback on this post: Andrew Chapello, Andrew Hsu, Peter Pelberg, and Mustafa Khan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                                <title>Followr, Twitter Bots, and Ethical Considerations</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;Twitter has a massive problem: new users have an extremely difficult time getting started. People who give it a chance and invest real time into the network usually fizzle out after a couple days, leaving without a clue as to what makes it great. Case in point: I now consider myself an active Twitter user, though it took 6 tries and 5 years to finally ‘get it’. Oh, and I’m in the frigin’ tech industry!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you join Twitter you have no followers — it’s like being brought into an empty room and being told “have fun!” Even though you can stare at a wall for 2 minutes before leaving, the average person is going to leave a heck of a lot quicker. You can import your friends and contacts lists, but that’s a long shot – chances are those people aren’t using Twitter either. For people to follow you, you need to fill out a fancy bio, tweet some interesting things, and hope people find you by luck. Oh, but Twitter’s sign up process must help… right? Wrong. It tells you to follow influencers, the people who are least likely to listen to what you have to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these barriers hit you in the face before you derive any value from the product. I believe Twitter has a potential thousands of times greater than its current footprint, but it has to fix this problem. Until it does, I believe helping them out a bit to be a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;opportunity-in-the-depths&quot;&gt;Opportunity In The Depths&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beauty of Twitter is its simple architecture. There is a lot you can do with it; even though the default functionality is lacking, we can make it better ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can we make Twitter better? I think there can be many pieces to this puzzle and now is the time to get creative. One of the best solutions I’ve found lies in the most controversial of places: automation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every “traditional” twitter bot I’ve seen was written with two goals in mind: First, to avoid detection and second, to gain followers in vast numbers. Absolutely everything else is at the expense of these two goals, and thus, bots tarnish the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That got me thinking, could you make a bot that truly enhances the network?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I asked around, many people seemed to have a vendetta against all automation within social networks. I think this is due to historically poor bot design. Automation itself is not bad, but is in fact critical to the effectiveness of all modern applications. Certain tasks simply suit themselves towards automation: email newsletters, notification clustering, information collection and analysis, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter bots can take many types of actions, including following and then unfollowing users, auto-replying, and favoriting tweets. All of these actions are disingenuous, favoriting being the least. That’s the negative. The positive lies with the cold, hard fact that favoriting tweets gets you followers — the same possible followers you likely need as a new user to make Twitter useful. So what if you could outweigh the negative with the positive?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introducing-followr&quot;&gt;Introducing Followr&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I’m releasing a little project called &lt;a href=&quot;http://ztratar.github.io/followr&quot;&gt;Followr&lt;/a&gt; to the public. Followr is a Twitter bot, pure and simple, but it aims to be very different than the status quo in three ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Instead of being a menace to the Twitter ecosystem, &lt;strong&gt;Followr’s goal is to be the first truly tasteful bot&lt;/strong&gt; — the first bot designed to actually help holistically improve Twitter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Followr is open-source&lt;/strong&gt;. I’ll be happy if others pitch in to make it even better.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Followr is a chrome extension. It uses the native Twitter website as a proxy to work its magic, so &lt;strong&gt;it can’t be shut down with ease&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between Followr and traditional Twitter bots lies in the net value created. A tasteful bot does vastly more good than harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be lying if I said Followr is a ‘pure’ tool. The truth is that results matter more: Followr makes Twitter a more friendly, usable network. It enables more people to discover you through shared interests. It can theoretically help give a voice to every individual whose at an unfair advantage because they came to the game late. I sincerely hope it can help you as it has helped the others I started it for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-it-work-how-will-it-work&quot;&gt;How does it work, how will it work?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first version, released today, has minimal functionality. It takes a list of topics you like, searches for tweets about them, and favorites a couple of them. Whereas traditional bots favorite a massive amount of tweets and spam, Followr only favorites 12 or so tweets every 30 minutes your browser is open. For Twitter members with high follower counts this won’t do much, but for those new to the system it can make the experience. Followr also rewards you with more favorites when you interact with others through legitimate discussions and retweets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though much improvement is still possible, after observing the habits of users, I’ve found that Followr, in its current form, creates a net positive value. I think it could made substantially more effective by implementing and improving in some key areas, such as the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligent Tweet Selection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some automatically favorited tweets will resonate with you while others won’t. A better bot can increase the number of the former and minimize the latter, making the favorites more valuable and giving you better connections with better people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better Behavior Driven Rewards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning on Followr and never going back to Twitter would be a terrible thing. This is why Followr should learn your behavior over time and reward you for doing good. If you use Twitter like a bot, Followr should ideally shut itself off. There are many ideas that can be explored in this vertical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analytics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many people followed me organically vs Followr? Right now, the analytics for that answer aren’t built. Followr can’t do some basic things, like give weighted priority to one topic over another or check if you’re already followed by a user it’s favoriting. It also has a severe “pretty graph” deficiency, which most certainly requires a remedy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whatever you can think up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have an idea? We can talk about it on Github Issues or on Twitter! Shoot me a tweet &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/zachtratar&quot;&gt;@zachtratar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some will disagree with this approach and that’s ok. I know it’s a tad controversial, but I find it naive to deem good automation impossible. It can be done. Since Followr is a chrome extension, it will auto-update on people’s browsers as improvements are created. I’m excited to what the future holds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ztratar.github.io/followr&quot;&gt;You can download Followr here&lt;/a&gt;. If you like it, please review it! Don’t like it? I’m all ears.&lt;/p&gt;
