<p>OK, maybe it&#8217;s not a &#8220;secret&#8221;, but bloggers are in a frenzy today after Apple reported $13.1 billion dollars in pure profit.</p>

<p>In perspective:</p>

<p>Apple is now worth more than Greece. Apple&#8217;s cash reserves are now near $100 billion. The UN states $30 billion can end world hunger. Apple&#8217;s making more profit than Google makes revenue. Damn. Now that&#8217;s capitalistic dominance. Good for you Apple!</p>

<p>Apple is run by deep-seated principles from the late role model of mine, Steve Jobs. These principles have defined the products pushed out the door, but have also streamlined the organization into a buzz-crazy, super-secret, money-making machine.</p>

<p>People love Apple&#8217;s products because they work well and because they&#8217;re &#8220;magical&#8221;. But what makes them so magic?</p>

<p>Apple&#8217;s design team, led by <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Ive'>Jonathan Ive</a> is the world&#8217;s best. They have carved their own mountain of a niche in the industry by focusing on beauty. While all the other computer manufacturers were focusing on specs, Apple made a product so ridiculously good-looking that even Zoolander would use it.</p>

<p>Look at the chart from <a href='http://macworld.com/'>Macworld</a>. Apple&#8217;s huge climb to fame started when they stacked the deck on the iPhone and new technology. They didn&#8217;t follow the curve, they made it. The same design principles that were on Mac were ported to an entirely new device, and thus, although first-time users had never used a touch-screen phone before, it felt simple enough but retained it&#8217;s &#8220;magic&#8221;.</p>

<p>All the sudden, it&#8217;s the future seen in movies such a Minority Report. Point being, Apple makes products people naturally want to show to their friends and family.</p>

<h2 id='exploit_the_niche'>Exploit the niche</h2>

<p>Since Apple had such a unique position in the market and had high demand, they were able to charge extraordinary prices for their products (and still do, though now it&#8217;s less extreme). This is why Apple&#8217;s revenue is around $40 billion and their profit is $13 billion, while Walmart reports $100 billion and $3 billion. They sell on emotion, and people follow their emotion.</p>

<p>This process, also, in practice, created another great effect: people value things that are more expensive. We all do it because we&#8217;re materialistic jerks. If it costs more, we take greater care of it and focus more attention on it&#8217;s value.</p>

<p>Go make your business as magical as Apple! Try donating a bit to the UN hunger effort though if you get over $100 billion.</p>
