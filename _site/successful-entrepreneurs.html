<p>The tech industry is a haphazard, chaotic scramble of companies, capital, and recruiters. Among this craze, I have been lucky enough to meet, and in some cases befriend, some very talented people - from VCs and CEOs to contractors trying to get their foot in the door.</p>

<p>There is one characteristic that seems to be very polarized in the valley: heart.</p>

<p>So, that&#8217;s what I want to talk about.</p>

<p>When I say that someone has heart, what I mean is that they are seriously emotionally involved with their work. They do what they do for a reason, and that reason is not encompassed solely by logic. It&#8217;s that purely human urge to move forward.</p>

<p>I believe heart is the essential ingredient to a Silicon Valley &#8220;success story.&#8221; People either have it or they don&#8217;t, and after talking to someone for 5 minutes, it&#8217;s usually obvious where they stand.</p>

<p>Building from the heart means:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>If out looking for a job, you don&#8217;t choose a company because you want to network with the founders or get a fantastic salary. You choose a company because what you&#8217;ll be working on blows your mind.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>You get excited every time you pitch your product/idea because you re-realize that what you&#8217;re doing is easily worth the hardship.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>When your friends say &#8220;Why do you work so much?&#8221;, you think &#8220;work&#8230;? This is play.&#8221;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>You do whatever it takes to see the vision become reality - whether that means learning to pitch or learning to program. (Or squatting at AOL, like my friend Eric).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>You get impatient. Not because you&#8217;re directly mad at yourself or others, but because the damn thing isn&#8217;t built yet and you want to use it!</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>When someone tries to poach you, you mirror it back! If they want to work with you, they better join you, not vice-versa.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>If you don&#8217;t have heart, it&#8217;s my opinion that you&#8217;re not working on the right idea. If you do, keep doing what you&#8217;re doing and luck will find it&#8217;s way to you.</p>
